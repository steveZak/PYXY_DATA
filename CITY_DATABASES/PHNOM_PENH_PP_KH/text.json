        "wiki": "The Royal Palace (Khmer: \u1796\u17d2\u179a\u17c7\u1794\u179a\u1798\u179a\u17b6\u1787\u179c\u17b6\u17c6\u1784\u1793\u17c3\u1796\u17d2\u179a\u17c7\u179a\u17b6\u1787\u17b6\u178e\u17b6\u1785\u1780\u17d2\u179a\u1780\u1798\u17d2\u1796\u17bb\u1787\u17b6, Preah Barum Reachea Veang Nei Preah Reacheanachak Kampuchea; French: Palais royal de Phnom Penh), in Chey Chumneas, Phnom Penh, Cambodia, is a complex of buildings which serves as the royal residence of the king of Cambodia. Its full name in the Khmer language is Preah Barum Reachea Veang Chaktomuk Serei Mongkol (Khmer: \u1796\u17d2\u179a\u17c7\u1794\u179a\u1798\u179a\u17b6\u1787\u179c\u17b6\u17c6\u1784\u1785\u178f\u17bb\u1798\u17bb\u1781\u179f\u17b7\u179a\u17b8\u1798\u1784\u17d2\u1782\u179b). The Kings of Cambodia have occupied it since it was built in the 1860s, with a period of absence when the country came into turmoil during and after the reign of the Khmer Rouge.\nThe palace was constructed between 1866 and 1870, after King Norodom relocated the royal capital from Oudong to Phnom Penh. It was built atop an old citadel called Banteay Kev. It faces approximately East and is situated at the Western bank of the cross division of the Tonle Sap River and the Mekong River called Chaktomuk (an allusion to Brahma).\n\n\n== History ==\n\n \nThe establishment of the Royal Palace in Phnom Penh in 1866 is a comparatively recent event in the history of the Khmer and Cambodia. The seat of Khmer power in the region rested in or near Angkor north of the Great Tonle Sap Lake from 802 AD until the early 15th century. After the Khmer court moved from Angkor in the 15th century after destroyed by Siam, it first settled in Phnom Penh which back then named as Krong Chatomok Serei Mongkol (Khmer: \u1780\u17d2\u179a\u17bb\u1784\u1785\u178f\u17bb\u1798\u17bb\u1781\u179f\u17b7\u179a\u17b8\u1798\u1784\u17d2\u1782\u179b) in 1434 (or 1446) and stayed for some decades, but by 1494 had moved on to Basan, and later Longvek and then Oudong. The capital did not return to Phnom Penh until the 19th century and there is no record or remnants of any Royal Palace in Phnom Penh prior to the 19th century. In 1813, King Ang Chan (1796\u20131834) constructed Banteay Kev (the 'Crystal Citadel') on the site of the current Royal Palace and stayed there very briefly before moving to Oudong. Banteay Kev was burned in 1834 when the retreating Siamese army razed Phnom Penh. It was not until after the implementation of the French Protectorate in Cambodia in 1863 that the capital was moved from Oudong to Phnom Penh, and the current Royal Palace was founded and constructed.\n\nAt the time that King Norodom (1860\u20131904) the eldest son of King Ang Duong, who ruled on behalf of Siam, signed the Treaty of Protection with France in 1863, the capital of Cambodia resided at Oudong, about 45 kilometres northeast of Phnom Penh. Earlier in 1863 a temporary wooden Palace was constructed a bit north of the current Palace site in Phnom Penh. The first Royal Palace to be built at the present location was designed by architect Neak Okhna Tepnimith Mak and constructed by the French Protectorate in 1866. On the year of 1865, year of the cow, at nine o'clock in the morning, King Norodom moved the Royal court from Oudong to the new Royal Palace in Phnom Penh and the city became the official capital of Cambodia the following year. Over the next decade several buildings and houses were added, many of which have since been demolished and replaced, including an early Chanchhaya Pavilion and Throne Hall (1870). The Royal court was installed permanently at the new Royal Palace in 1871 and the walls surrounding the grounds were raised in 1873. Many of the buildings of the Royal Palace, particularly of this period, were constructed using a combination of traditional Khmer architectural but also incorporating significant European features and design as well. One of the most unusual surviving structures from this period is the iron-sided Napoleon Pavilion which was a gift from France in 1876. It is currently closed to the public for renovations because of its poor state of conservation.\nKing Sisowath (1904\u20131927) made several major contributions to the current Royal Palace, adding the Phochani Hall in 1907 (inaugurated in 1912), and from 1913-1919 demolishing several old buildings, and replacing and expanding the old Chanchhaya Pavilion and the Throne Hall with the current structures. These buildings employ traditional Khmer artistic style and Angkorian inspired design, particularly in the Throne Hall, though some European elements remain. The next major construction came in the 1930s under King Monivong with the addition of the Royal Chapel, Vihear Suor (1930), and the demolition and replacement of the old Royal residence with the Khemarin Palace (1931), which serves as the official Royal residence to this day. From the reign of King Sihanouk, other significant additions are the 1956 addition of the Villa Kantha Bopha to accommodate foreign guests, and the 1953 construction of the Damnak Chan originally installed to house the High Council of the Throne.\n\n\n== Buildings of the Royal Palace ==\nThe complex is divided by walls into four main compounds. On the south side is the Silver Pagoda, to the north side is the Khemarin Palace and the central compound contains the Throne Hall and to the west is the private sector or the Inner Court. The buildings of the palace were built gradually over time, and some were dismantled and rebuilt as late as the 1960s. Some older buildings date back to the 19th century.\n\n\n== Architecture and Area ==\nThe Royal Palace of Cambodia is a fine example of Khmer architecture with a slight French touch featuring its layout of the defensive wall (kampaeng), throne hall (preah tineang), Temple of the Emerald Buddha (Wat Preah Keo Morakot), stupas (chedei), towering spires (prang prasat) and mural paintings. The Royal Palace of Phnom Penh covers an area of 174,870 square metres (1,882,300 sq ft) (402m x 435m).\n\n\n=== Throne Hall ===\n\nThe Preah Tineang Tevea Vinnichay Mohai Moha Prasat or \"Throne Hall\" (Khmer: \u1796\u17d2\u179a\u17c7\u1791\u17b8\u1793\u17b6\u17c6\u1784\u1791\u17c1\u179c\u17b6\u179c\u17b7\u1793\u17b7\u1785\u17d2\u1786\u17d0\u1799\u1798\u17a0\u17d0\u1799\u1798\u17a0\u17b6\u1794\u17d2\u179a\u17b6\u179f\u17b6\u1791) means the \"Sacred Seat of Judgement.\"\n\nThe Throne Hall is where the king's confidants, generals and royal officials once carried out their duties. It is still in use today as a place for religious and royal ceremonies (such as coronations and royal weddings) as well as a meeting place for guests of the King. The cross-shaped building is crowned with three spires. The central, 59-metre spire is topped with the white, four-faced head of Brahma. Inside the Throne Hall contains three royal thrones (one is more of western style and the other two are traditional) and golden busts of Cambodians kings and queens starting from the reign of King Ang Doung onwards. This Throne Hall is the second to be built on this site. The first was constructed in 1869-1870 under King Norodom. That Throne Hall was demolished in 1915. The present building was constructed in 1917 and inaugurated by King Sisowath in 1919. The building is 30x60 metres. As with all buildings and structure at the Palace, the Throne Hall faces east and is best photographed in the morning. When visiting note the thrones (Reach Balaing in front and Preah Thineang Bossabok higher at the back) and the beautiful ceiling frescoes of the Reamker. To the north of the thrones stands the statue of His Majesty Sisowath Monivong standing holding the Royal Sword. The statue is made with gold and shows him dressed in casual clothes. While to the south of the thrones stands the gold statue of His Majesty King Sisowath sitting on the Preah Thineang Bossabok dressed and covered with the Royal Regalia of Cambodia (as you can see he is wearing the Crown, the Sopourna Bat or the royal footwear and in his right hand holds the Royal Sword. He sits on the Preah Thineang Bossabok which is made to look like the real one to the right.\nThe traditional throne or The Preah Tineang Bossabok (Khmer: \u1796\u17d2\u179a\u17c7\u1791\u17b8\u1793\u17b6\u17c6\u1784\u1794\u17bb\u179f\u17d2\u1794\u17bb\u1780) is an ancient nine-level classical Khmer-style throne. Each Khmer King has to be seated on it on the coronation day while wearing the Royal Regalia. It is covered with intricate floral carvings and has two levels of small statues of Garudas lifting the upper part of the bossabok. Three of the nine levels of the throne represent the levels of hell, middle earth and the heavens. Surrounding the bossabok are the four gold nine-tiered umbrellas, these are called the Aphirom (Khmer: \u17a2\u1797\u17b7\u179a\u1798\u17d2\u1799). Finally, the bossabok is topped by the white Royal Nine-tiered umbrella (Khmer: \u1796\u17d2\u179a\u17c7\u1798\u17a0\u17b6\u179f\u17d2\u179c\u17c1\u178f\u1786\u17d0\u178f\u17d2\u179a) that signifies the universal power the king has. In front of the bossabok is the throne. The table that stands next to the Royal Throne holds on it a golden tea set and the golden set of betel and areca nuts container set, which are part of the regalia and are always on the table, or otherwise called the Pean Preah Srei (Khmer: \u1796\u17b6\u1793\u1796\u17d2\u179a\u17c7\u179f\u17d2\u179a\u17b8). Behind the preah thineang bossabok is another bossabok called the Preah Tineang Nearyrath Sophea (Khmer: \u1796\u17d2\u179a\u17c7\u1791\u17b8\u1793\u17b6\u17c6\u1784\u1793\u17b6\u179a\u17b8\u179a\u17d0\u178f\u17d2\u1793\u179f\u17c4\u1797\u17b6), the Preah Thineang Bossabok is for the king and the Preah Thineang Nearyrath Sophea at the back is for the queen. Like every king has to sit on the front bossabok, every queen also needs to sit on the taller bossabok behind. After sitting on the bossaboks while wearing the regalia, the kings and queens will be escorted to their palanquins to be paraded around the city.\n\n\n=== Moonlight Pavilion ===\n\nThe Preah Thineang Chan Chhaya (Khmer: \u1796\u17d2\u179a\u17c7\u1791\u17b8\u1793\u17d0\u1784\u1785\u17d0\u1793\u17d2\u1791\u1786\u17b6\u1799\u17b6) or \"Moonlight Pavilion\", is an open-air pavilion that serves as stage for Khmer classical dance in the past and present. It is one of the most notable buildings of the palace as it easily seen from the outside as it was built alongside a section of the palace walls. The Chan Chhaya Pavilion has a balcony that was used as a platform for viewing parades marching along Sothearos Boulevard of Phnom Penh. The current Pavilion is the second incarnation of the Chanchhaya Pavilion, this one constructed in 1913\u201314 under King Sisowath to replace the earlier wooden pavilion built under King Norodom. The current pavilion is of a similar design as the earlier version. The Chanchhaya Pavilion dominates the facade of the Palace on Sothearos Blvd. The Pavilion serves as a venue for the Royal Dancers, as a tribune for the King to address the crowds and as a place to hold state and Royal banquets. Most recently, the Pavilion was used for a banquet and a tribune for the new King at the 2004 coronation of King Norodom Sihamoni.\n\n\n=== Silver Pagoda ===\n\nThe Silver Pagoda is a compound located on the South side of the palace complex. It features a royal temple officially called Preah Vihear Preah Keo Morakot (Khmer: \u1796\u17d2\u179a\u17c7\u179c\u17b7\u17a0\u17b6\u179a\u1796\u17d2\u179a\u17c7\u1780\u17c2\u179c\u1798\u179a\u1780\u178f) but is commonly referred to as Wat Preah Keo (Khmer: \u179c\u178f\u17d2\u178f\u1796\u17d2\u179a\u17c7\u1780\u17c2\u179c). Its main building houses many national treasures such as gold and jeweled Buddha statues. Most notable is a small crystal Buddha (the \"Emerald Buddha\" of Cambodia) \u2013 undetermined whether made of Baccarat Crystal in 19th century or of other kind of crystal in 17th century \u2013 and a near-life-size, Maitreya Buddha encrusted with 9,584 diamonds dressed in royal regalia commissioned by King Sisowath. During King Sihanouk's pre-Khmer Rouge reign, the Silver Pagoda was inlaid with more than 5,000 silver tiles and some of its outer facade was remodelled with Italian marble.\nThere are also other structures surrounding the main building or the vihear. To the east is the statue of King Norodom sits on a white horse. To the north of the vihear is the library.  At the northwestern corner is the bell tower and south of that is the model of Angkor Wat. South of the vihear stand four structures: from west to east the Chedi (stupa) of H.M. King Suramarit and Queen Kossamak, the Dharmasala, the Chedi of Princess Kantha Bupha and The Phnom Mondop (mount mondop) where the statue of Preah Ko is situated. The wall that surrounds the structures is covered with the painting of the epic story of Reamker but because neglected care, the bottom half of the painting faded throughout the years.\n\n\n=== Khemarin Palace ===\nThe Khemarin Palace is the common English name for a building called Khemarin Moha Prasat (Khmer: \u1781\u17c1\u1798\u179a\u17b7\u1793\u17d2\u179a\u17d2\u178f\u1798\u17a0\u17b6\u1794\u17d2\u179a\u17b6\u179f\u17b6\u1791) [Prasat (temple or palace) Khmer + Indra] or in Khmer meaning the \"Palace of the Khmer King.\" It is used as an official residence of the King of Cambodia. This compound is separated from other buildings by a small wall and is located to the right of the Throne Hall. The main building is topped with a single spired prang.\n\n\n=== Other structures ===\nOther structures include, Hor Samran Phirun, Hor Samrith Phimean, Damnak Chan, Phochani Pavilion (dance hall), Serey Monkol Pavilion (royal conference hall), King Jayavarman VII Pavilion, Vihear Suor (royal chapel), Villa Kantha Bopha, Villa Chumpou, Villa Sahametrei, and some less significant buildings in an area closed to the public.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n=== Gardens ===\n\nThe palace has various gardens with tropical flowers and plants, such as Allamanda cathartica, Couroupita guianensis and Jatropha integerrima.\n\n\n== The Royal Palace today ==\nThe Royal Palace has had some major modifications to its buildings over time; nearly all of the King Norodom era buildings have been demolished completely. The King's living area (closed to public) has also undergone big changes. In the 1960s at Queen Kossamak's command the Silver Pagoda was rebuilt due to the original aging structure being too weak to stand.\nThe palace has always been a popular tourist attraction in Phnom Penh. Visitors are able to wander around the Silver Pagoda compound and the central compound containing the Throne Hall and Chan Chhaya Pavilion.  The King's living area, which actually takes up half of the total palace ground area, including Khemarin Palace, Villa Kantha Bopha, Serey Mongkol Pavilion, royal gardens, and a number of other buildings and pavilions, is closed to the public.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n=== Citations ===\n\n\n=== Bibliography ===\n\n\n== External links ==\n Media related to Royal Palace, Phnom Penh at Wikimedia Commons\n\nNational Radio | The Royal Palace\nCambodian Ministry of Tourism | Royal Palace of Phnom Penh\nLeisure Cambodia | Article about the riverfront shrine\n6 Photos with descriptions - The Royal Palace, Phnom Penh\n84 High quality digital photos of the palace taken by an amateur photographer",

          "I enjoyed my visit to the Royal Palace. The grounds are beautiful and the buildings quite magnificent. It\u2019s an eye opener to see the poor side of Phnom Penh to the richness of the Royal Palace. Allow 1 1/2 hrs here to take in the area and buildings. You won\u2019t be dissapointed.",

          "Nice experiences to learn a country with its own unique architecture and its people. It was a pleasant day with our guide and driver. My husband and I enjoyed a lot! Highly recommend to anyone to come to Phnom Penh, don't miss it!"

          "not really worth the $10 unless you're REALLY into architecture, murals, etc.  There is almost no signage that has information about the different places and the map they give you doesn't tell you much about the buildings, you need a guide \u2026",

Phnom Penh has been the national capital since French colonization of Cambodia, and has grown to become the nation's economic, industrial, and cultural center.\nOnce known as the \"Pearl of Asia,\" it was considered one of the loveliest French-built cities in Indochina in the 1920s. Phnom Penh, along with Siem Reap and Sihanoukville, are significant global and domestic tourist destinations for Cambodia. Founded in 1372, the city is noted for its historical architecture and attractions. It became the national capital in 1434 following the fall of Angkor, and remained so until 1497. It regained its capital status during the French colonial era in 1865. There are a number of surviving French colonial buildings scattered along the grand boulevards.\nOn the banks of the Tonl\u00e9 Sap, Mekong, and Bassac Rivers, Phnom Penh is home to more than 2 million people, approximately 14% of the Cambodian population.\n\n\n== Etymology ==\nPhnom Penh (literally, 'Penh's Hill') takes its name from the present Wat Phnom ('Hill Temple'). Legend has it that in 1372, a wealthy widow named Lady Penh found a Koki tree floating down the Tonle Sap river after a storm. Inside the tree were four bronze Buddha statues and a stone statue of Vishnu. Daun Penh ordered villagers to raise the height of the hill northeast of her house and used the Koki wood to build a temple on the hill to house the four Buddha statues, and a shrine for the Vishnu image slightly lower down. The temple became known as Wat Phnom Daun Penh, which is now known as Wat Phnom, a small hill 27 metres (89 ft) in height.\nPhnom Penh's official name, in its short form, is Krong Chaktomok (Khmer: \u1780\u17d2\u179a\u17bb\u1784\u1785\u178f\u17bb\u1798\u17bb\u1781) meaning \"City of Four Faces\".

This loosely translates as \"The place of four rivers that gives the happiness and success of Khmer Kingdom, the highest leader as well as impregnable city of the God Indra of the great kingdom\".\n\n\n== History ==\nFirst recorded a century after it is said to have taken place, the legend of the founding of Phnom Penh tells of a local woman, Penh (commonly referred to as Daun Penh (\"Grandmother Penh\" or \"Old Lady Penh\") in Khmer), living at Chaktomuk, the future Phnom Penh. It was the late 14th century, and the Khmer capital was still at Angkor near Siem Reap 350 km (217 mi) to the north. Gathering firewood along the banks of the river, Lady Penh spied a floating koki tree in the river and fished it from the water. Inside the tree she found four Buddha statues and one of Vishnu.\nThe discovery was taken as a divine blessing, and to some a sign that the Khmer capital was to be brought to Phnom Penh from Angkor. To house the new-found sacred objects, Penh raised a small hill on the west bank of the Tonle Sap River and crowned it with a shrine, now known as Wat Phnom at the north end of central Phnom Penh. \"Phnom\" is Khmer for \"hill\" and Penh's hill took on the name of the founder, and the area around it became known after the hill.\nPhnom Penh first became the capital of Cambodia after Ponhea Yat, king of the Khmer Empire, moved the capital from Angkor Thom after it was captured and destroyed by Siam a few years earlier. There is a stupa behind Wat Phnom that houses the remains of Ponhea Yat and the royal family as well as the remaining Buddhist statues from the Angkorean era. In the 17th century, Japanese immigrants also settled on the outskirts of present-day Phnom Penh. A small Portuguese community survived in Phnom Penh until the 17th century, undertaking commercial and religious activity in the country.\nPhnom Penh remained the royal capital for 73 years, from 1432 to 1505. It was abandoned for 360 years (from 1505 to 1865) by subsequent kings due to internal fighting between the royal pretenders. Later kings moved the capital several times and established their royal capitals at various locations in Tuol Basan (Srey Santhor), Pursat, Longvek, Lavear Em and Oudong.\nIt was not until 1866, under the reign of King Norodom I (1860\u20131904), the eldest son of King Ang Duong, who ruled on behalf of Siam, that Phnom Penh became the permanent seat of government and capital of Cambodia, and also where the current Royal Palace was built. Beginning in 1870, the French colonial authorities turned a riverside village into a city where they built hotels, schools, prisons, barracks, banks, public works offices, telegraph offices, law courts, and health services buildings. In 1872, the first glimpse of a modern city took shape when the colonial administration employed the services of French contractor Le Faucheur to construct the first 300 concrete houses for sale and rental to Chinese traders.\nBy the 1920s, Phnom Penh was known as the \"Pearl of Asia\", and over the next four decades, Phnom Penh continued to experience rapid growth with the building of railways to Sihanoukville and Pochentong International Airport (now Phnom Penh International Airport). Phnom Penh's infrastructure saw major modernisation under the rule of Sihanouk.During the Vietnam War, Cambodia was used as a base by the People's Army of Vietnam (PAVN) and the Viet Cong (VC) and thousands of refugees from across the country flooded the city to escape the fighting between their own government troops, the PAVN/VC, the South Vietnamese and its allies and the Khmer Rouge and the American air strikes. By 1975, the population was 2\u20133 million, the bulk of whom were refugees from the fighting. The Khmer Rouge cut off supplies to the city for more than a year before it fell on April 17, 1975. Reports from journalists stated that the Khmer Rouge shelling \"tortured the capital almost continuously,\" inflicting \"random death and mutilation\" on millions of trapped civilians. The Khmer Rouge forcibly evacuated the entire city after taking it, in what has been described as a death march: Fran\u00e7ois Ponchaud wrote that \"I shall never forget one cripple who had neither hands nor feet, writhing along the ground like a severed worm, or a weeping father carrying his ten-year old daughter wrapped in a sheet tied around his neck like a sling, or the man with his foot dangling at the end of a leg to which it was attached by nothing but skin\"; Jon Swain recalled that the Khmer Rouge were \"tipping out patients from the hospitals like garbage into the streets....In five years of war, this is the greatest caravan of human misery I have seen.\" All of its residents, including the wealthy and educated, were evacuated from the city and forced to do difficult labour on rural farms as \"new people\". Tuol Sleng High School was taken over by Pol Pot's forces and was turned into the S-21 prison camp, where people were detained and tortured. Pol Pot sought a return to an agrarian economy and therefore killed many people perceived as educated, \"lazy\" or political enemies. Many others starved to death as a result of failure of the agrarian society and the sale of Cambodia's rice to China in exchange for bullets and weaponry. The former high school is now the Tuol Sleng Genocide Museum, where Khmer Rouge torture devices and photos of their victims are displayed. Choeung Ek (The Killing Fields), 15 kilometers (9 mi) away, where the Khmer Rouge marched prisoners from Tuol Sleng to be murdered and buried in shallow pits, is also now a memorial to those who were killed by the regime.\nThe Khmer Rouge were driven out of Phnom Penh by the PAVN in 1979, and people began to return to the city. Vietnam is historically a state with which Cambodia has had many conflicts, therefore this liberation was and is viewed with mixed emotions by the Cambodians. A period of reconstruction began, spurred by the continuing stability of government, attracting new foreign investment and aid by countries including France, Australia, and Japan. Loans were made from the Asian Development Bank and the World Bank to reinstate a clean water supply, roads and other infrastructure. The 1998 Census put Phnom Penh's population at 862,000; and the 2008 census was 1.3 million.\n\n\n== Geography ==\nPhnom Penh is in the south-central region of Cambodia, and is fully surrounded by Kandal Province. The municipality is on the banks of the Tonl\u00e9 Sap, Mekong, and Bassac Rivers. These rivers provide freshwater and other natural resources to the city. Phnom Penh and the surrounding areas consist of a typical flood plain area for Cambodia. Although Phnom Penh is at 11.89 metres (39 ft) above the river, monsoon season flooding is a problem, and the river sometimes overflows its banks.\nThe city, at 11.55\u00b0N 104.91667\u00b0E\ufeff / 11.55; 104.91667 (11\u00b033' North, 104\u00b055' East), covers an area of 678.46 square kilometres (262 sq mi), with some 11,401 hectares (28,172 acres) in the municipality and 26,106 ha (64,509 acres) of roads. The agricultural land in the municipality amounts to 34.685 km2 (13 sq mi) with some 1.476 km2 (365 acres) under irrigation.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nPhnom Penh has a tropical wet and dry climate (K\u00f6ppen climate classification Aw). The climate is hot year-round with only minor variations. Temperatures typically range from 22 to 35 \u00b0C (72 to 95 \u00b0F) and weather is subject to the tropical monsoons. The southwest monsoon blows inland bringing moisture-laden winds from the Gulf of Thailand and Indian Ocean from May to November. The northeast monsoon ushers in the dry season, which lasts from December to April. The city experiences the heaviest precipitation from September to October with the driest period in January and February.\nThe city has two distinct seasons. The rainy season, which runs from May to November, sees high temperatures accompanied by high humidity. The dry season lasts from December to April; when overnight temperatures can drop to 22 \u00b0C (72 \u00b0F).\n\n\n== Administration ==\n\nPhnom Penh is a municipality of area 678.46 square kilometres (261.95 sq mi) with a government status equal to that of Cambodian provinces. The municipality is divided into 14 administrative divisions called khans (sections). The sections are subdivided into 105 sangkats (quarters), and further subdivided into 953 phums (villages).  All khans are under the governance of the Phnom Penh Municipality. Dangkao, Meanchey, Porsenchey, Sen Sok and Russei Keo are considered the outskirts of the city.\nThe municipality is governed by the governor who acts as the top executive of the city as well as overseeing the Municipal Military Police, Municipal Police, and Bureau of Urban Affairs. Below the governor is the first vice governor and five vice governors. The chief of cabinet, who holds the same status as the vice governors, heads the cabinet consisting of eight deputy chiefs of cabinet who in turn are in charge of the 27 administrative departments. Every khan (district) also has a chief.\n\n\n== Demographics ==\nAs of 2019, Phnom Penh had a population of 2,129,371 people, with a total population density of 3,136 inhabitants per square kilometre in a 679 square kilometres (262 sq mi) city area. The population growth rate of the city is 3.92%. The city area has grown fourfold since 1979, and the metro area will continue to expand in order to support the city's growing population and economy.\nPhnom Penh is mostly inhabited by Cambodians (or Khmers). They represent 90% of the population of the city. There are large minorities of Chinese, Vietnamese, and other small ethnic groups who are Thai, Budong, Mnong Preh, Kuy, Chong, and Chams. The state religion is Theravada Buddhism. More than 90% of the people in Phnom Penh are Buddhists. Chams have been practicing Islam for hundreds of years. Since 1993, there has also been an increase in the practice of Christianity which was practically wiped out after 1975 when the Khmer Rouge took over. The official language is Khmer, but English and French are widely used in the city.\nThe number of slum-inhabitants at the end of 2012 was 105,771, compared with 85,807 at the start of 2012.Note: As stated in the \"History\" paragraph (The 1998 Census put Phnom Penh's population at 862,000; and the 2008 census was 1.3 million.) the information collides with the information provided in the \"Historical population\" table. Needs editing.\n\n\n== Politics ==\n\n \nPhnom Penh is allocated 12 seats in the National Assembly, making it the largest constituency.\n\n\n=== Members of Parliament ===\n\n\n== Economy ==\n\nPhnom Penh is Cambodia's economic centre as it accounts for a large portion of the Cambodian economy. Double-digit economic growth rates in recent years have triggered an economic boom in Phnom Penh, with new hotels, restaurants, schools, bars, high rises and residential buildings springing up in the city.\nThe economy is based on commercial interests such as garments, trading, and small and medium enterprises. In the past few years the property business has been booming, with rapidly increasing real estate prices. Tourism is also a major contributor in the capital as more shopping and commercial centres open, making Phnom Penh one of the major tourist destinations in South East Asia along with Siem Reap and Sihanoukville. According to the World Travel and Tourism Council, tourism made up 19.2 percent (US$2,053 million) of Cambodia's GDP in 2009 and accounts for 13.7 percent of total employment. One of the most popular areas in Phnom Penh for tourists is Sisowath Quay, alongside the Tonle Sap River. Sisowath Quay is a five kilometre strip of road that includes restaurants, bars, and hotels.The US$2.6 billion new urban development, Camko City, is meant to bolster the city landscape. The Bureau of Urban Affairs of Pnochina Penh Municipality has plans to expand and construct new infrastructure to accommodate the growing population and economy. High rise buildings will be chinesely constructed at the entrance of the city and near the lakes and riverbanks. Furthermore, new roads, canals, and a railway system will be used to connect Camko City and Phnom Penh.\nOther projects include:\n\nGrand Phnom Penh International City (under construction)\nDe Castle Royal Condominium (Completed)\nGold Tower 42 (On hold 32 floors construction begins again in the mid of 2018)\nOCIC Tower (Completed)\nKokling super second floor house\nVattanac Capital Tower (completed)\nThe Bridge (Completed)\nThe Peak (under construction)\nWith booming economic growth seen since the 1990s, new shopping venues have opened: Sorya Center Point, Aeon Mall Phnom Penh, Aeon Mall Sen Sok City, Olympia Mall, and Parkson Mall (under construction). Many international brands have opened such as Mango, Salvatore Ferragamo, Hugo Boss, Padini Concept Store, Lily, Timberland, Jimmy Choo, CC Double O, MO, Brands Outlet, Nike, Converse, Pony, Armani Exchange, and Super Dry.\nThe tallest skyscraper in Phnom Penh is Vattanac Capital Tower at a height of 188 metres (617 ft), dominating Phnom Penh's skyline with its neighbour skyscraper Canadia Tower (OCIC Tower). The tower was completed in December 2014. Modern high rises have been constructed all around the city, not concentrated in any one particular area.\nThe Central Market Phsar Thmei is a tourist attraction. The four wings of the yellow colored market are teeming with numerous stalls selling gold and silver jewelry, antique coins, clothing, clocks, flowers, food, fabrics and shoes. Phsar Thmei is undergoing under a major renovation, along with the creation of newer stalls.\n\n\n== Education ==\n\n\n=== Universities and colleges ===\n\n\n=== Primary and secondary schools ===\n\n\n=== International schools ===\n\n\n=== Supplementary and extra schools ===\nThe Japanese Supplementary School of Phnom Penh , formerly known in English as the Phnom Penh Japanese School, is a part-time Japanese School, operated by the Japanese Association of Cambodia (JACAM;\u30ab\u30f3\u30dc\u30b8\u30a2\u65e5\u672c\u4eba\u4f1a Kambojia Nihonjin-kai). It is in Sangkat Toek Thla in Sen Sok. It was established in 2002. It had 60 students in June 2011.\n\n\n== Culture ==\nPhnom Penh also has its own dialect of Khmer. Speakers of the Phnom Penh dialect often elide syllables, which has earned it the reputation for being lazy speech. Phnom Penh is also known for its influence on New Khmer Architecture. Phnom Penh is notable for Ka tieu Phnom Penh, its variation on rice noodle soup, a dish available in sit-down cafes as well as street cafes.\nMusic and the arts are making a revival throughout Cambodia, especially in Phnom Penh. Phnom Penh currently hosts a number of music events throughout the city. 'Indie' bands (those without corporate sponsors) have grown in number due also in part to the emergence of private music schools such as SoundsKool Music (also operating in the city of Siem Reap), and Music Arts School (registered as an NGO).\nThe two most visited museums in the city are the National Museum, which is the country's leading historical and archaeological museum, and Tuol Sleng Genocide Museum, a former Khmer Rouge prison. The National Museum hosts celebrations of Cambodian dance and music, including a popular classic Apsara dance show of traditional folk dances as well as original creations.\nChaul Chnam Thmey April 13\u201315\n\nAt this time, Phnom Penh celebrates Cambodian New Year, an occasion increasingly popular with tourists. During this typically hottest part of the year, water gets thrown around adding to the party atmosphere along with dancing and music. The precise date changes year-by-year but this holiday lasts, at least, three days. This festival marks the turn of the year based on the ancient Khmer calendar and also marks the end of the prior year harvest.\nWater Festival November\n\nThe largest annual festival in Phnom Penh, this lively gathering celebrates the reversing of the flow of the Tonl\u00e9 Sap River. The holiday lasts three days as people flood into the city to enjoy the fireworks, boat races, live concerts, eating and partying. The boat racing dates back to ancient times marking the strengths of the Khmer marine forces during the Khmer Empire.\nOn 22 November 2010 at least 348 people were crushed to death in a bridge stampede at the festival.Pchum Ben October 11\u201315 (2012)\nPchum Ben is a very important aspect of Cambodian culture. It may be translated as \"gathering together\" to make offerings and is a time of reunion, commemoration, express love and appreciation for one's ancestors. By offering food and good karma to those possibly trapped in the spirit world, living relatives help assuage their misery and guide them back into the cycle of reincarnation.\nVisak Bochea May\n\nVes\u0101kha is an annual holiday observed traditionally by Buddhists in Cambodia. Sometimes informally called \"Buddha's Birthday\", it actually encompasses the birth, enlightenment (nirv\u0101\u1e47a), and passing away (Parinirv\u0101na) of Gautama Buddha.\n\n\n== Cityscape and architecture ==\n\nThe oldest structure is Wat Phnom from the founding days of the city, constructed in 1373. The main tourist attractions are the Royal Palace with the Silver Pagoda, and the National Museum, constructed during the French colonial era in the late-19th century in the classical Khmer style and hosting a vast collection of Khmer antiquities. The Independence Monument (Khmer: Vimean Akareach), although from the 1950s, is also constructed in the ancient Khmer style.\nThe French, who were the colonial masters from the 19th century to the 1940s, also left their mark, with various colonial villas, French churches, boulevards, and the Art Deco market Phsar Thom Thmei. A notable landmark of the colonial era is the Hotel Le Royal.\n\nStarting with independence from the French in the 1950s and lasting until the era of the Khmer Rouge in the 1970s, Phnom Penh underwent tremendous growth as the capital city of a newly independent country. King Sihanouk was eager to present a new style of architecture and thus invigorate the process of nation building. A new golden era of architecture took off, with various projects and young Khmer architects, often educated in France, given opportunities to design and construct. This new movement was called \"New Khmer Architecture\" and was often characterised by a fusion of Bauhaus, European post-modern architecture, and traditional elements from Angkor. The most prominent architect was Vann Molyvann, who was nominated chief national architect by the king himself in 1956. Molyvann created landmark buildings such as the Preah Suramarit National Theatre and the Council of Ministers building. Other architects helped construct the newly founded Royal Khmer University, the Institute of Foreign Languages, and the National Sports Centre. With the growth of the upper and entrepreneurial middle classes, new suburbs were built in the 1950s and 1960s. Although these buildings survived the Khmer Rouge era and the civil war, today they are under threat due to economic development and financial speculation. Villas and gardens from that era are being destroyed and redeveloped to make place for bigger structures. The landmark National Theatre by Molyvann was razed in 2008. A movement is rising in Cambodia to preserve this modernist heritage. Old villas are sometimes being converted into boutique hotels, such as the Knai Bang Chatt. \nMonuments and memorials to the genocide of the Khmer Rouge era in the 1970s are the Tuol Sleng Genocide Museum (a former high school used as a concentration camp) and, on the outskirts of the city, the Choeung Ek Genocide Center. The Cambodia-Vietnam Friendship Monument was commissioned by the Vietnamese communists as symbol of Khmer-Vietnamese friendship during the late-1970s following the liberation of Cambodia from the Khmer Rouge.\nThe population, foreign investment, and urban development in Phnom Penh grew dramatically during the 1990s and early-2000s. The rapid growth resulted in the city's infrastructure distinctly lacking (the drainage system is particularly notorious, and Phnom Penh frequently floods during the wet season), and a need for both residential and commercial spaces. The simultaneous demand for residential and commercial housing and the increase of international investment has led to the planning, if not construction, of several satellite cities. The largest of these cities are: Grand Phnom Penh International City, CamKo City, Diamond Island City, Boeung Kak Town, and Chruy Cangva City.\nOn the outskirts of the city, farmland has been developed into garment factories and housing for lower economic classes and those displaced by the new development in the city center.\n\n\n=== 2035 master plan ===\nOriginally intended to be completed by 2020, the 2035 master plan is a French-funded project for the development of Phnom Penh. Although the plan was approved by the Ministry of Land Management, Urban Planning and Construction in 2005, it has yet to be ratified by the Cabinet of Cambodia. The original plan details five edge-city projects connected to the historical city centre by waterways and tree-lined corridors.\n\n\n== Media ==\n\n\n=== Dailies ===\n\n\n==== Khmer ====\nSralagn' Khmer (Love Khmer)\nChakraval Daily (Universe)\nKampuchea Thmei Daily (New Cambodia)\nKampuchea Tgnai Nis (Cambodia Today)\nKanychok Sangkhum (Social Reflection)\nKoh Santepheap (Island of Peace)\nMoneaksekar Khmer (Khmer Conscience) \u2013 Published by the Sam Rainsy Party.\nRasmei Kampuchea (Light of Kampuchea) \u2013 Cambodia's largest daily, it circulates about 18,000 copies.\nSamleng Yuvachun (Voice of Khmer Youth)\nUdomkate Khmer (Khmer Ideal)\nWat Phnom Daily (Mount Temple)\n\n\n==== English ====\nPhnom Penh Post, a daily English-language newspaper published in Phnom Penh.\nThe Cambodia Daily, an English-language daily newspaper (closed in 2017).\nThe Khmer Times, an English-language daily newspaper.\n\n\n==== Chinese ====\n\u300a\u67ec\u83ef\u65e5\u5831\u300b(Jianhua Daily), a daily Chinese-language newspaper published in Phnom Penh.\n\u300a\u661f\u6d32\u65e5\u5831\u300b(Sin Chew Daily), a Chinese-language daily newspaper, the Cambodian edition of the Malaysian Chinese daily of the same name.\n\u300a\u83ef\u5546\u65e5\u5831\u300b(Huashang Daily), a Chinese-language daily newspaper.\n\u300a\u9ad8\u68c9\u65e5\u62a5\u300b(Khmer Daily), a Chinese-language daily newspaper.\n\u300a\u65b0\u67ec\u57d4\u5be8\u300b(New Cambodia), a Chinese-language daily newspaper.\n\n\n=== Magazines ===\nAsiaLIFE Guide Phnom Penh, a monthly English-language lifestyle magazine published in Phnom Penh.\nPocket Guide Cambodia publishes four separate guides aimed at English-speaking residents and visitors.\nF Magazine, the first fashion-forward magazine in Cambodia.

Cambodia has increasingly become involved in modern sports over the last 30 years. As with the rest of the country, football and the martial arts are particularly popular.  Ultimate fighting and freestyle boxing have also become more common in recent years.The most prominent sporting venue in the city is the Phnom Penh National Olympic Stadium with a capacity of 80,000\u2014although the country never hosted the Olympic Games due to disruption by the civil war and the Khmer Rouge in the 1970s. Built in 1964, it is home to the Cambodian national football team. On completion the stadium was one of the largest in Asia. Today it is the 6th largest stadium in Southeast Asia. Volleyball, basketball, and Tai-Kwon-Do games are often hosted at the stadium.  The stadium closed in 2000, but was redeveloped and reopened.\nThe National Sports Centre of Cambodia hosts swimming, boxing, and volleyball competitions. Noted local football clubs include Phnom Penh Empire, Khemara Keila FC and Military Police.\n\n\n== Transport ==\n\nPhnom Penh International Airport is the largest and busiest airport in Cambodia. It is seven kilometres west of central Phnom Penh. The airport is connected to the city center by taxi, train, and shuttle bus.\nCambodia's national flag carrier, Cambodia Angkor Air, launched in 2009, is headquartered in Phnom Penh and has its main hub there, with an additional hub at the Angkor International Airport.Air France used to serve Phnom Penh from Paris-Charles de Gaulle but this service has since stopped. Qatar Airways now flies to and from Phnom Penh, via Ho Chi Minh City.\nTaxis, pick-ups, and minibuses leave the city for destinations all over the country, but are fast losing ground to cheaper and more comfortable buses. Phnom Penh also has a rail service.\nThere are numerous bus companies, including Phnom Penh Public Transport and GST Express, running services to most provincial capitals, including Sihanoukville, Kampong Chhnang, Oudong and Tak\u00e9o. Phnom Penh Sorya Transport Co. offers bus service to several provincial destinations along the National Routes and to Ho Chi Minh City. Giant Ibis is another bus company based in Phnom Penh, which travels to Sihanoukville, Kampot, Siem Reap and Ho Chi Minh, and has free Wi-Fi, air conditioning and modest pricing.\nThe city is Cambodia's main freshwater port, a major port on the Mekong River. It is linked to the South China Sea, 290 kilometres distant, via a channel of the Mekong in Vietnam.\n\n\n=== Public transport ===\n\nPhnom Penh is served by three air conditioned bus lines. Initial attempts by the Japanese government to develop a Phnom Penh bus service began in 2001. An update of the JICA urban transport master plan for Phnom Penh was completed and implemented in 2014. The city is now served by three bus lines, operated by the Phnom Penh municipal government. Private transportation within the city include the cycle rickshaw, known in Khmer as \"cyclo\", the motorcycle taxi known in Khmer as \"moto\", the auto rickshaw known locally as \"tuk-tuk\", the trailer attached to a motorcycle taxi known in Khmer as \"remorque\", and the standard automobile taxicab known in Khmer as \"taxi\". Private forms of transportation used by locals include bicycles, motorbikes, and cars.\n\n\n=== Highways ===\n\nAs the capital of Cambodia, a number of national highways connect the city with various parts of the country:\n\n\n== Water supply ==\n\nWater supply in Phnom Penh has improved dramatically in terms of access, service quality, efficiency, cost recovery and governance between 1993 and 2006. The number of customers has increased ninefold, service quality has improved from intermittent to continuous supply, water losses have been cut dramatically and the city's water utility went from being bankrupt to making a modest profit. These achievements were recognized through international awards such as the 2006 Ramon Magsaysay Award and the 2010 Stockholm Industry Water Award. The city's water utility is the Phnom Penh Water Supply Authority (PPWSA). Its main water sources are the Mekong River, the Tonle Sap river and the Tonle Bassac river.\n\n\n== International relations ==\n\n\n=== Twin towns and sister cities ===\nPhnom Penh is twinned with:\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of markets in Phnom Penh\nSpecial Economic Zones of Cambodia\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\nGroslier, B.P.

          "I found this museum to be pretty average. The vast majority of the exhibitions are similar sandstone statues. A few exhibits were really cool and stood out but average overall. Audio tour was pretty good, wouldn't do it without it.",

          "Lots of artifacts--so much history. The audio tour was worth the cost, especially the mythology. Even our kids found the stories interesting.",
          "Interesting visit with our group tour guide, who gave us a lot of insight into the different exhibits and brought the history of Cambodia to life. I am not sure that I would have had the same experience if visiting independently. Quite a compact museum but with a lot to see.",
          "Usually I like to visit museums to learn about the history of a country, city and people. While the National Museum in Phnom Penh is on the list of places to visit and very close to the Royal Palace it is a given to visit. There are a few written tablets but mostly displays of",

          "The most incredible thing about this museum is the building and inner courtyard, both of which are exquisite. The contents however are a little hard to interact with, with very little info although I'd heard the audio guides go into far too much detail. Perhaps somewhere in the",
          "The National Museum is well worth visiting. The layout is good and the displays are also in English. Recommend.",

          "Very nice and exhaustive Museum describing arts, history, religious aspects of cambodian culture. Audio-guide is very smart, intuitive and easy to use. Building and places are beautifull and so peacefull. Location is also really good... Deserve at least 2 hours of visit!!!",

          "This is a very much worthwhile visit. Either before or after the temple visits you'll get a lot out of this museum. Great works, stunning carvings and great information (if you get the audio guide.) Yes it's a little overpriced but still really worth seeing. You can easily spend",

          "We wandered around this museum for around 90 minutes without a guide and there was enough information on site to understand the bulk of the exhibits. We enjoyed the area housing the statues best. The 4 sided building itself is imposing with a pleasant courtyard. Worth a visit.",

          "This place is just a must see if you love history! Most interesting for me were the inscriptions on stones and a trident that date from the 6th century and onwards! The sculptures that date from 6th century as well. The other interesting recovery and discovery are the two",

          "The key selling point for the National Museum of Cambodia is that it is home to the world\u2019s finest collection of Khmer sculpture. In the same vein I could argue that my house is currently home to the world\u2019s finest collection of my underpants, but would it be realistic to expect",
          "Well worth visiting. The architecture of the building and the gardens with ponds are stunning. The artefacts inside are incredible too, and there\u2019s a small cafe for snacks & refreshments. There\u2019s also free water.",
          "Museum was more of a storage unit for statues than an actual display. Waste $20 usd for me and my girlfriend. Much better of spending the money to see an actual temple.",

          "Good museum and lots of historical artifacts. Very peaceful place and not overly touristy. I thought the 10$ entrance fee was a little high and I was expecting more of a display of Cambodia\u2019s entire history, rather than nothing but statues and ceramic artifacts. Again a very",

          "There is a surprising number of items in the museum, although they can get a bit repetitive at times. The audio guide is a must because the exhibit signage is minimal. Cooling is provided by ceiling fans, not aircon so remember to stay hydrated.",
          "The artifacts they have there are without a doubt very interesting and old. The amount of things to see are unreal. The museum just isn\u2019t as captivating as you would expect. If you were to choose between the museum or the cultural show, pick the cultural show. Especially if you",
          "There are very few tourist attractions in Phnom Penh. The museum is next to the Royal Palace. There are three areas relating to the three periods of their history.",

          "If I had time for only one thing to see or do in Phnom Penh, it would be the National Museum. While the curation is definitely old fashioned, the collection is world quality. Start by going clock wise, to the pre-Angkorian dynasties with statues that look like, say, Crete and",
          "Great to see so many ancient artifacts all in a beautiful setting. Only $10 for adults so not expensive and worth the cost to support the efforts. Make sure to walk around the entire building outside as there are many things to see in the gardens.",

          "I have to agree with the other reviewers that the National museum wasn't worth our effort to get there. It was overpriced at $10USD in comparison to what else you can do in PP instead. Admittedly we didn't use the audio guide but just read the inscriptions. We had planned to",

          "There is a $15 charge for entrance and audio. If you enjoy 11th Century artifacts then you are in luck. This museum is awash in huge findings from Siem Reap. There is literally an audio for every exhibited article. The English is excellent and easy to follow. You can also",

          "Did The National Museum Tour after The Palace Tour as it is only a 15 minute walk. They do have an audio tour which is ok but not great and goes into too much detail. To be honest i thought the museum was a bit disappointing with so many statues of buddha and all very similar.",
          "After reading the reviews I was unsure about whether to visit or not, but was glad I did. It is not the most modern of museums I have visited and I can appreciate why some people like it and some don't. If you are interested in Ancient Khmer artifacts, they have a wonderful",
          "I loved the museum so much that I spent a few hours there then went back the next day for another few hours. It helps if you have a either strong historical, art-history, history of religion, or anthropological interest. But it's wonderful in any case.",

          "It's easy to see that this was once a great museum--the architecture alone is very impressive. However, it needs curation and an injection of funds. A number of members of my family are museum buffs, who've visited museums in all kinds of places (including many in countries",
          "An impressive collection of Cambodian artefacts with numerous well preserved statues and stone works. The museum is not that big but there is a lot to read for those who like all the detail. $1 to photograph them. The centre of the museum is a garden and water feature as well as",
          "Perhaps more truly a 3.5 star attraction but it is certainly one of the best tourist sites in Phnom Penh. The collection of statues dating from the 6th century is very impressive. There is not a lot else in the museum so it is probably of most interest to an expert. $10 entry is",
          "A huge assortment of artefacts sorted in an understandable chronological order. There is so much, if you tried to read and listen ( they have audio headsets) you would spend a couple of days here. The works are very accessible and you can get up close and see the amazing detail",
          "Largely statues/relics from old temples, but very few signs or explanations. Perhaps would be better with a guide, but otherwise it did not seem worth the money, which was disappointing as I am generally a museum person.",
          "I made a quick stop at the National Museum on Phnom Penh on a recent trip there. It was my first time in Cambodia and with my limited knowledge of Cambodian history I was able to piece a few things together. I think this museum is done well but it wasn't inherently obvious",
          "I was told visitng national museum is must do before visiting angkor wat and other temples.. it was so worth it. I had a guide who took me through the museum and it was totally worth it.. visit here before going to angkor wat",
          "The place is not so big , yet has so much to see , the design of the buidling is amazing too Small water gardens in the middle makes it very relaxing",
          "Visited in April, only cover very very early history of combodia times. All artifices can be seen better if you are planning a visit to Angkor wat - morning ch better. Expensive entry at US$10.00 each. Don\u2019t bother.",

          "I am not used to complain about pricing but this place is very overpriced. The price increased recently, you now have to pay a 10$ entry fee and if you also want the audio guide you must add 5 more dollars... Before the entry fee was 5$ ! 50% increased. Note than the Royal",
          "There are many different buddha images that was gifts for king inside the big temple hall. Next to the big ball there is small temple covered by trees. It was interesting prying place for monks (must visit). Inside wall around museum area is a story about good and bad sprites",

          "We stopped here as part of a full day tour but did not enjoy it at all. It is expensive at $10 per person entry and very average to poor displays inside. Nice gardens in the centre but that\u2019s about all. Give it a miss if you can, unless you are an artifacts person or type of",
          "The building is quite beautiful but it is not the sparkling (and perhaps sterile) modern museum building that you see in Siem Reap. Most of the exhibit spaces are not air conditioned and open to the outside air. But this roughness is what makes this museum quite charming.",
          "It is a quiet place with a mixture of history, art, crafts, culture and ancient folklore. The ambient and atmosphere is positive to spend a couple of hours there.",
          "Some interesting sculptures which are very old and give you an idea of the long history of Cambodia, but it\u2019s a small museum with minimal information provided so not worth the USD10pp entrance fee by any means.",
          "Like most Asian museums, you really need to get yourself an audio guide to fully appreciate the exhibits but, if you're happy just roaming around on your own, you can work things out for yourself. It was really interesting to see all of this first hand before we visited any of",
          "This is the National Museum and it is not accessible at all. There are steps to enter the museum and then 95% of the artifacts are down another set of steps. We actually purchased tickets and then found out there were steps.",
          "Beautiful garden. Typical Cambodian architecture. Visitors are confronted with what feels like hundreds of statues, but little info on what it is all about. Not a must visit museum.",
          "Next door to the national palace. $10 to get in. Has audio guide which I didn't realise. But most of the exhibits have the detail in English. Very informative.",
          "I headed here because the royal palace was closed for midday and I expected a lot more for the price. It\u2019s a square building where the perimeter is filled with statues of old temples/ gods. There isn\u2019t much information unless you pay the extra $5 for the audio set - which I",
          "We are on a tour of SE Asia and we had a museum guide. Unfortunately he was hard to understand and even though our group was only 20 it was hard to know what he was talking about unless you were lucky enough to be standing right next to him! The window is not air conditioned",
          "Lots of Hindu statues, which may interest some folk - but not us! Much of the display material came from Angkor Wat.",
          "10$ for a lot of sculptures without information or real history of the nation. A little bit sad. Building looks great from the outside but inside its little bit old. Garden is really nice though",
          "Probably he only museum where I been asked by folks inside for dollars. I watched a man sell flowers to place in front of buddha than take the flowers and resell them. Museum was very hot with only a couple of fans. Most of the artifacts come from Seim Reap so if you have",
          "The National Museum is housed in a lovely rust red building showcasing a collection of Khmer artifacts. Many of the pieces came from Angkor in Siem Reap. I found my interest waning after about an hour. It is a fine stop to make as long as not too much time is spent here. There",
          "The museum is very small and one sided as far as the exhibit is concerned. Aside from the Royal Palace, this is another site not really worth seeing. But they charge you $10 for it! So, I wouldn't recommend it.",
          "An oasis amongst the hustle and bustle of Phnom Penh. Very interesting collection of Khmer artefacts collected throughout Cambodia, not least from Angkor Wat",
          "If you and Art love this collection of stunning Khymer Art will impress you as will the building.The range of figures and artefacts depicting the scale, structure and range of the Khymer Empire is breath taking. What is lacking is more interpretation, explanation about the",
          "A lot of very large statues, most of Hindu gods and goddesses reflecting the Hinduism roots of the country. Definitely worthwhile visit. Photos are not allowed.",
          "If you go with a guide you will get something out of seeing the artifacts but if you are reliant on the sparse interpretation accompanying the pieces it isn't very informative. However, it is a miracle as much cultural material survived the anti-intellectualism of the Khmer",
          "The visit to this museum was part of our tour. Although many of the exhibits have great historical importance, I\u2019m afraid it didn\u2019t have the wow factor",
          "The museum has lots of statues that originated from the Indian subcontinent. There are some good artifacts to learn about Cambodian history.",
          "Lots of old artefacts here, especially from Siem Reap temples. We didn\u2019t go round with a guide as ours isn\u2019t allowed in , could have gone round with museum guide but was advised that everything is labelled; which it is but minimal information. Gardens are nice inside",
          "I would suggest visiting the National Museum on your first day in Phnom Penh as it provides a good background of the Khmer Empire and Cambodia. The museum is small and can be viewed in less than 2 hours, but it is full of beautiful statues and wood carvings. The main highlight",
          "The museum only contains old artifacts (cutlery and religious statues). I was hoping to learn about Cambodia's history and its people, so found the experience underwhelming (especially for $10+) You can hire an audio headset to learn more about what you are observing - so this",
          "Was hoping to see a little bit more on the history of Cambodia than was available. Was mainly a collection of relics and artifices",
          "Nothing but statues ofBuddhas and Hindu gods. The on,y redeeming feature was that they are old, but I wished I hadn\u2019t bothered",
          "I enjoyed the museum building, the architecture is is the original style and quite beautiful. I am sure the relics in the museum are important and a good representative of Cambodian art and history, however they did not resonate with me. I think I needed descriptions that did",
          "Fantastic exhibits of Khmer history..many statues and artifacts, If you are into ancient times you could find yourself staying for a long time there- also visited here in Dec 2017. Indian, Khmer and sculpture plus Angkor - things from 4th century on. (Get a guide it is",
          "I spent about 1-2 hours here to kill time while waiting for the Royal Palace's 2 pm open session. If you are really into history, arts and culture like me, I suggest you rent an audio guide while you are there. It gives very detailed information for most of the artifacts you can",
          "Good location right on St 136 but far away enough from the 136 nightlife (100m) to get a good nights sleep! Friendly staff and nice clean rooms. WiFi was good as was the satellite TV. Overall a decent hotel, would stay again.",
          "The museum had plenty of interesting artefacts but I found the presentation and display very dry. It felt like one statue after another and didn't hold my interest for long (I have an archaeology degree!)",

          "We weren\u2019t sure if we were going to visit the National Museum because the reviews were so-so. The admission is $10 plus the cost of audio guide. We first tried to enter the Royal Palace but found out it was closed from 11am-2pm so we decided to visit some wats and the National",
          "A nice museum to pass an hour. We had the audio tape but didnt need it and that made it quite an expensive hour. I expected more history of this lovely country",
          "If you have a big interest in Khmer history, this is a great place to visit. There are a lot of things to see, but after a while I felt it was a little repetitive. The audio \"tour\" is okay but doesn't link any one thing to another or direct you through the museum in any order,",
          "A fascinating look at antiquities from the Angkor period, namely statues. Sadly most of these are missing arms or heads! The signage is limited but you can always search extra information using Google or use the audio guide. This museum was a welcome rest from the heat of the",
          "Unfriendly staff, crazy prices (10USD + 5USD for audio guide). The \"museum\" is a mid size temple with like 40 different objects inside (you'll see the same statues over and over again). Maximum time before being bored : 40mn",
          "There\u2019s some really interesting pieces here but the whole thing felt very unfinished. It took us only 40 mins to go around the whole thing and we didn\u2019t just smile and nod at the exhibits and move on. Some of the pieces taken from the temples would have been better off where",
          "entry fee is like 10 USD. i feel its a bit overpriced. otherwise a small and nicely organised meuseum. many food shops and a nice park located just near to this location. good rainy day activity and u can spend 1 hour easily here. in the evening they also organise few other",
          "A relatively small museum but worth a visit. There isn't many English descriptions of the artefacts so you must purchase the audio tour for 5$. If you don't you will not understand a great deal. Photos are permitted but cost 1$ to use",
          "Nice museum with an interesting collection. Unfortunately things are not always well signed and $10 is way too much for the quality and size of the museum. Alternatively, if you have to choose, the royal palace was also $10 and better value imo.",
          "The museum was well laid out and exhibits were clearly labelled. However if you want to find out about the Khmer culture and temples the museum in Siem Reap was better. Worth a visit but if doing both Siem Reap and Phnom Penh and short of time, do the museum in Siem Reap.",
          "The museum has an amazing collection of artifacts mainly sculptures and reliefs. It is probably a paradise for historians and art historians but unfortunately, the way these treasures are presented is quite hermetic and not very friendly for a lay person. We rented an audio",
          "Friday afternoon 11th January and we visited this Museum, which was crammed with artifacts, which are housed in a mighty impressive red coloured building, not far from the Royal Palace. The museum houses one of the world's largest collections of Khmer art, including sculptures,",
          "Quite an interesting museum!!! Very well manicured grounds. The stone sculptures are quite impressive. Not very crowded. A peaceful retreat from the hectic streets of Phnom Penh. Nice little seating area to enjoy a juice in the shade beside the open grassy area. If we had not",
          "This is a really lovely museum. The building materials are wood and it feels much more approachable after a morning at the National Palace. The inside of the museum houses a courtyard with lotus ponds and shaded arcades around the outside of this courtyard. Some of the statuary",
          "Every time I go to PP I go to the Museum. I can't get enough of the forms that buddha was envisioned over the years by the various sects, especially with the Hindu influence. These are prize pieces you can see and get right next to, and the audio tour is very helpful to give",
          "Nice museum containing Khmer pre-Angkorian, Angkorian and 18th to 20th century artifacts. Many of the statues and artwork that are missing from the ruins in Angkor Wat, Sambor Prei Kuk and other sites can be seen here.",
          "Take the audio tour its better. We went here to learn more about Cambodia before we continue our journey.",
          "If you loved Ankgor Wat and the other temples in Siem Reap, you won't want to miss this museum. Great sculptures from the same period and some of the same temples are found here, but the National Museum in Siem Reap is much better organized. This one has more important art",
          "Lot's of statuary -- beautiful pieces. Some charming artifacts and a pleasant garden. If you have visited many of the temples and wondered why they lacked statues, this is the place to see what originally inhabited the temple. I recommend it.",
          "Nice stop off for a day trip in Phnom penh. Nice to see all the glorys history of Cambodia. Puts things into perspective.",
          "Not much to see but still a good collection of old artifacts. Better get the audio if your lazy to read or just want a better explanation.",

          "The price of 10$ per person is way to high for what you get. We also paid an additional of 6$ for a personal guide. The guide was horrible! It was a woman with som disabilities so she walked extremely slow and talked extremely low with a very bad pronaunciation. We couldn\u2019t",
          "This can be as long or short visit was you like. I spent about 30 mins. There are lots of artefacts. Not sure you need the audio as there are brief descriptions. See if you can find the moon rock!",
          "At $10 per adult, the museum is rather expensive for what it is. The artefacts, while great are still completely unknown to us as the descriptions were all one line and explained nothing about the artefact. You could however rent an audio guide for additional$5 each, but being",
          "Very disappointed because whilst you do get to some extremely old sculptures and that is great, there are one line explanations, nothing interactive and the whole thing was same/same but different. How they can charge $15 AUS for this is astounding! Total rip off - don't bother.",
          "I have been to Angkor Wat many times, which I am sure helps to put the contents of much the National Museum into context. But the museum covers much more than just the Angkor Period. It has galleries stretching from prehistoric times, to the Bronze Age and Pre-Angkor Period,",
          "Museum has 4 wings of artefacts from the Khmer history We got the audio guide which was good so you don\u2019t need to hire a guide at all We spent about 1.5 hours there and that was plenty and we were definitely Buddahed out by then. The Audio guide has more than 250 entries!!!!!",
          "If you are stressed for time, and trying to keep your expenses low, you can walk through the gardens without paying. The building is also impressive, true to the Cambodian building style.",
          "Plenty of historical pieces in the area but quite not much perfect stall and a bit hot as no air condition",
          "The only reason I have gone again is because we have gone with visitors from out of town. But I wont go again. The increase to admission to this place is not commensurate with its value. In fact I think, compared to regional attractions, especially in Vietnam, this is very and",
          "This place is a must visit for lovers of art. The artwork is amazing and the different times in history are so clearly defined and the work is just amazing",
          "lots of them. We had a guide but wished we got an audio guide. Lots to take in of the pre, Angkor and post periods.",
          "This was a short but interesting visit. It is national museum but mostly about Buddhist artefacts. you need to go to the genocide museum to appreciate what this country has experienced",
          "This is a beautiful building showing some of the statues or similar statues that would have been in the temples of Angkor Wat and elsewhere. Very good layout to just wander around in a a square and then the lovely gardens in the middle where you can sit and just enjoy the",
          "Lots to look at. The audio tour was a bit overwhelming, but listening to some of it was good for context.",
          "I gave this an \"Average\" review, but it's a low \"Average\" if you ask me. Objectively it's an OK museum if you like to wander and look at things. If you want to learn about Cambodian history it's really out of order and has no particular theme. It's also in pretty rough shape as",
          "Some of the greatest pieces of sculpture art in human history, displayed in a French-Khmer Gesamtkunstwerk and not ruined by modern museum pedagogy (which you indeed get in Siem Reap). Guys! This is not for people needing explanations all the time; just shut up for a mo' and",

          "Disappointing compared to other museums. There is a wonderful collection of ancient statues and frescos but no narrative of Cambodia and no other history apart from the ancient stuff. The worst bit is that children under 18 get half price admission but only if you show a",
          "My experience here is coloured by my experience of the museum in Siem Reap. In terms of the richness of artefacts, the national museum just cannot compete with what the one in Siem Reap has to offer. If this is your first time to cambodia, then this is a worthwhile stop.",
          "Skip it, unless you are a broken sculpture lover, there is nothing else to see (many don't even have dates). I was hoping for more history. Go if you must but if time is limited skip it.",
          "Honestly, I was looking forward to visiting the National Museum. When we got there, I was like, NO way, this cant be it. I have heard that this is worth popping by to learn lots. But, it turned out otherwise unfortunately :( The only thing, I was clearly happy about was that",
          "This is hardly a museum; more a collection of buddhist and hindu figures and carvings from various ages. You can hire a recorded explanation for the absolute detail. Laid out symmetrically a la Angkor Wat it is four sides with ponds in the interior.",
          "A small but interesting museum with several well preserved statuary in an architectural beautiful building -- the courtyard is especially peaceful. Worth a half hour visit.",
          "It's not a huge museum, but it has key bits and I would highly recommend a visit prior to a trip to Angkor Wat. It has one of the earliest uses of the number \"0\" on one of the exhibits. We've been twice!",

          "Located in a beautiful Khmer style building, the national museum of Cambodia is a must see attraction while in Phnom Penh. It showcases Khmer culture and history from pre-history, through the Khmer empire up until the French colonial era. Beautiful thousand year old sculptures",

          "It's a fairly small museum. For foreigners, it's probably a better use of time to go to Tuol Sleng and the Killing Fields, as those are much more valuable in telling the history. Only some of the artifacts have English descriptions, and the audio guide costs even more. I would,",
          "Given the historical value of the artifacts, the exhibits are second rate, poorly lit, and not very well organized",
          "Visited towards the end of a long day of sightseeing, lots of artefacts but we were experiencing \u201cmuseum overload\u201d by that point so wandered around looking instead of reading the descriptions. You must pay USD1 for camera permit or USD3 for video permit",

          "The entrance fee is 10$ for an adult + 5$ for an audio-guide as an option. There are lots of small and big statues from the Angkor period, as well as relatively fresh exhibitions also with statues. My view is that the red price for the entrance should be maximum 5$ for what you",
          "I wouldn't recommend this attraction. It was very expensive for what you get to see. Obviously lots of statues. I didn't do the audio tour, and there wasn't any information on display.",
          "This museum consists mainly of sand stone statues from the 11th or 12th century. We spent about 30 minutes here and it was more than enough. If you\u2019re short on time you could probably skip this stop and not miss much.",
          "This museum has some beautiful pieces in it and the building is lovely. There are certainly better museums in the world ( Siem Reap for example) but it was enjoyable to wander through. It is somewhat expensive for the experience but we visited during a downpour so it was a good",
          "Have to say the most memorable thing about this place is the very agreeable inner courtyard gardens....the artefacts of course are what it\u2019s all about but being Cambodia one is bombarded with images of such artefacts from the moment you arrive... They are spectacular in their",
          "It's absolutely worth going to if you want to learn about the history of the country. Make sure your legs and shoulders are covered so that you're permitted inside. This holds true for almost all places of historical importance at Cambodia but no one will tell you beforehand. We",
          "Rather expensive to enter for what it is. Loads of artefacts on view here from the last 1000 years. Housed in a beautiful building.",
          "I've been to Angkor National Museum but this National Museum has more collections about inscriptions and very good for researchers. For me still worth it!",
          "Know before you go, this museum houses lots of amazing finds from historical periods up to 1,000 years ago. But if you do not have a museum guide (none available when we went) or pay for the audio tour, there is not much information available on the collection. The collection",
          "10 U$ as entry fee is quite overpriced given the size of the museum. I packed more informative texts. If you had seen the Ankgor wat is nothing new. The building however is very nice.",
          "A huge marvelous collection. Well organized and well explained. One of the world's largest collections of Khmer art, including sculptural, Khmer ceramics, bronzes, and ethnographic objects. Its collection includes over 14,000 items, from prehistoric times to periods before,",
          "I spent two hours here and I would love to spend a longer time here if it wasn't because it had to close in the evening. You can choose a tour guide to explain things to you but I paid USD5 more to get an audio guide. I had been to Angkor Wat before I came here, so I felt",
          "My review is a little late but hopefully not too much has changed since May! The museum is full of Khmer sculptures, and many other artefacts, including pre-Angkorian pottery and bronzes. Each item has information on it's origins, meaning, and if I remember correctly, where",
          "Great place to visit and see some truly wonderful sculptures and other works of art. The building is also very inspiring",
          "I really enjoyed the museum but I will go back. I spent two hours there today but I kinda rushed through the last parts. I don\u2019t like doing that. The audio tour is nice and it really works well. It does cost a bit to see the museum and have the audio tour in English. But the",
          "This really isn't worth it. Beyond many statues of Buddhas and Hindu gods there isn't really much to see.",
          "Beautiful buildings and surrounds. Because of Cambodian recent history this museum is still being developed. But it was good to go and walk through the displays. Certainly not the Australian government had assisted with funding for the roof restoration.",
          "Expected way more from the $10 entrance. Not really much to see or much variety. Pretty courtyard and cafe.",
          "I visited here to see some local History. It is worth the visit yet there seems to be something missing. There are English and French explanations across the Museum also audio phones and guides. Recent history is lacking.",
          "If you need to kill some time in PP, the museum is an ok place to do it. Lots of ancient statues, endless audio sessions available. Became a tad bit repetitive though. No air condition.",
          "The National Museum is interesting, but not large. There are quite open expansive rooms - open to the outside - so it has more of an aeroplane hangar feel. You can move inside and outside quite freely. The small courtyard garden is nice. You are not able to take photographs",
          "I was impressed at first because for a extra 5 dollars you could have a self guided tour. After experiencing the genocide museum and killing fields self guided tour I was all for it. Well it was disappointing and pretty lame in my opinion! The most enjoyable part of the",
          "This is a well layed out display of many of the ancient artifacts of Cambodia. They are well displayed - some times in clean glass cases - sometimes in the open. It is well located near the palace with easy access by Tuk Tuk. The display scans many centuries and represents many",
          "There aren't any exciting in this place no variety just one repeated idea, so any one can see if he was near and have a time to spend no else",
          "I toured the museum after the Palace, so naturally it wasn\u2019t as sparkly or quite frankly as interesting. It does gives a great history of the country through costume, pottery, statues and other historic items from archeological sites. It just not very interactive. There are",
          "It is a very nice museum but small and it looks like a temple, very traditional Cambodian architecture. Worth a visit if you have time.",
          "The National Museum in Phnom Penh is a very expensive fun. The museum looks more like a large art exhibition. Mainly Buddha statues are to be admired. Unfortunately, you learn very little about the history of Cambodia here. The courtyard of the National Museum is beautiful,",
          "It is ok to see if you have time. But if you don't have the time to visit don't worry as you are not really missing much. You can buy tickets here for a traditional dance diner show for $30.",
          "It looks more like a temple but it actually is a museum housed in a terracotta-roofed structure of traditional Cambodian design. On display were a collections of ceramics, bronzes and other amazing artifacts during & after the Khmer & Angkor Era. It was not crowded inside and we",
          "Some of the exhibits are exquisite - but their presentation is poor. The museum looks a bit like a semi-outdoor storehouse with a pseudo-historical architecture.",
          "This is Cambodia\u2019s largest museum of cultural history and archaeological, religious and political artifacts. It is somewhat of a small museum and collection but in line with what I would expect from a country the size of Cambodia. The building, gardens, and sculptures are very",
          "Just visited the museum and was not impressed by the collection. True, I\u2019m not a huge museum fan, but had seen many in SE Asia, but was really expecting more for a 10$ entrance fee. (I read that they doubled the entrance fee in October 2017). I\u2019d say that 5$ would be a fair",
          "It\u2019s probably worth a visit to clarify dates and eras of temples and surrounding antiquities but not really that interesting although the guidon gets us lovely and the grounds are very pretty ! While there worthwhile buying a ticket and returning at night fir the ballet ! The",
          "The nice building hosting the museum worth the visit also for the beautiful green yard. The collection of statues is interesting and gives an overview about the Cambodian art and history.",
          "The building is beautiful and so is the courtyard inside. There is an exhibition inside which if you\u2019re into I guess is interesting. We however, walked around but were really admiring the surroundings. We stayed maybe half an hour. Others stayed longer",
          "Was decided to visit it for 2 reasons : the museum and the place that does includ a nice central garden. Museum is interesting proposing certain aspects of the Cambodian history. Great introduction. Place is also quiet and peaceful after the visit to stay few minutes just",
          "This museum is located beside of Royal Palace (5 mins walk distance). Entry fee is US$5 (or 42000 Riel) and audio guide is US$5. Small-medium size museum and mainly displayed ancient Khmer and some Buddha related items. There is a small garden in the centre of the museum where",
          "We came all the way from Ho Chi Minh by a private van and arrived in Phnom Penh past lunchtime. National museum was supposed to be last in our itinerary but since it closes at 5pm, we decided to do it first. From the outside, it looks more like a temple but it actually is a",
          "The museum was immaculate. Everything was incredibly preserved and laid out. There were plenty of written information accessible per room although the audio tour would give you a bit more context into the magnitude of what you're experiencing. Well worth the cost of entry.",
          "Yes, this place also deserves a visit . Normally, you will not miss it if you are visiting royal palace and silver pagoda. Its location is quite close to them and the visit to it is also interesting, but for that you have to have interest in cambodia history.",
          "Visited the museum in August. It is OK. Lots (and lots) of statues from the Angkor period. And clearly a collection that has been extensively sourced and lovingly maintained. I think we\u2019d like there to have been a lot more extensive history of Cambodia covered in the overall",
          "I'm not a museum person by nature, but on the day it was a choice between the Genocide Museum, and the National Museum. Not wanting to be apalled by the ugliness and sheer brutality beyond belief of the entire Cambodian Genocide catstrophy, I opted for the National Museum, and",
          "This museum is well worth a visit, and the bonus is that it isn't terribly large, so it won't take up all day. They have some interesting items on display with one I really didn't expect to see in Cambodia of all places; a piece of moon rock from the Apollo 17 mission in 1972.",
          "I went by the museum yesterday and really enjoyed it. I thought it was a little expensive as compared to other places I have been. The collection is well laid out in a beautiful old building, some of it is being restored in these days. Lots of figurines and tons of statues.",
          "Visited the museum August the 5th. Had a very bad start with the ticket selling women. They didn\u2019t accept my dollar bills because they were old. The women were very unfriendly and obnoxious. So I had to get some local cash from an ATM to get in. The museum is very interesting",

          "Amazing pieces of art from as early as the 6th? Century. I was expecting to learn more about Cambodian history in general. Don\u2019t go expecting this!!!! It really is a massive display of amazing old statues. $10 entry and $5 audio. There were plenty of written descriptions so",
          "The museum was ok. It showed lots of statues that had been taken from siem reap which would have looked better with the old temples themselves. The museum is just worn down rooms with lots of statues in them. If you are not going to siem reap, come to this museum to get a",
          "It cost $10 to enter and $15 if you want an audio. Many artefacts are numbered and you can listen to detailed information about them. There was a lot of information and history about the Hindu gods. Some relics from Angkor Way are also displayed here. The building itself is",

          "As with the palace this has some spectacular pieces in it but $10 is high for what you get. Especially as there seems to be little in the way of preservation or presentation going on. Pretty much a large pile of impressively old, exquisite cultural artefacts left to the good",
          "Beautiful palace but not as large s complex as I expected and smaller than the equivalent palace in Thailand",

          "It\u2019s one of the only main attractions in Phnom Penh so is worth a visit. The best part for me was actually the beautiful building it was in and the relaxing interior garden. If your day allows plan to spend some time here reading a book or even having lunch if you brought",
          "Well-presented information covering the history of Cambodia. There is a LOT to take in so definitely eat an audio guide. The building itself is also really interesting to look at, although the they are doing some renovation work at the moment so the first floor isn\u2019t open.",

          "Visited the museum early in the day. Entry price US $10 and $5 for audio. Items are presented well with limited information, hence the use of the audio is helpful. Some items such as books and castings are available for purchase. Lovely grounds surrounding the building.",
          "We wandered around for about 45 minutes, looking at the poorly-signed artifacts. Normally there are specially trained guides to escort you through and explain stuff, but we visited on a Saturday afternoon, which is all of their days off (apparently). Perhaps if you are super",
          "Reasonable entry fee, I didn\u2019t get the audio guide which is $5 USD. It has a lot of interesting artifacts, I especially like those lintels of Angkor. But the lightning is very poor, a lot of dark corners, which didn\u2019t help the presentation of those wonderful treasures!",
          "This museum explained a lot of the Temples of Angkor in the Siem Reap area. It is best to use a guide or do the self guided audio tour. A lot of what is in the Angkor temples are reproductions with the originals are in the National Museum. Be sure to allow at least an hour",
          "The museum has some interesting exhibits, especially from the Angkor and pre-Angkor eras, but is not too well laid out or signposted",

          "For 10 dollars this is not good value for money. You do not even get a map. the architecture is great, but the entire experience much less so. If you have a choice, there is a very much better private museum in Siem Reap. The price for foreigners has doubled from 5 to 10 dollars",
          "Lovely building, much of which can be seen from outside. There are SO MANY statues of Buddha and other cultural images.......if that\u2019s your thing then \u201cGreat\u201d, but we glazed over in minutes and just enjoyed the garden and its serenity.

          "I had some expectations for a national museum as I visited those in the UK and Singapore, which gave you a glimpse of this country\u2019s establishment and history. However, with the US$10 it charged, I only got a beautiful architecture to take some photos of, lots of similar statues",
          "Magnificent Wooden Structure. Why go to Cambodia and not take in the Khmer culture. Worth admission. Beautiful grounds. Cambodian Living Arts Project located at back. Stage for classic Khmer dance and music ensemble. Also a nice quiet coffee shop.",

          "I never miss this place when visiting Phnom Penh. It's a beautiful escape of the rapidly growing city. The garden is beautiful and the collection is interesting. It's rare to see open air museum. You feel the air and sun through the opened windows, very unique experience.",
          "Visited the museum this week and spent about 2.5 hours perusing the incredible ancient artworks of the Khmer empire. I regret having not sprung for the audio tour, but still absolutely enjoyed making my way through solo. Beautiful and stunningly crafted pieces of jewelry,",
          "Many lovely Cambodian stone carvings, some from Angkor Wat. Detailed wood carvings with traditional local gods. Cambodian State Religion is a form of Buddhism, so most of the carvings are of Buddha in many different poses. $10.00 USD admission for foreigners.",
          "Well worth a visit but the focus seems to be more on the art of Cambodia rather than the country's history (although there is, of course, an overlap between the two). Items are presented in the old-fashioned museum way and I found it worth paying extra for the audio guide.",
          "Not bad for a look at artifacts to give you the history of Cambodia over the ages. Possibly just our guide, but it was like enduring paint drying. Go have a self guided look, but think about whether you want or need the guide?",
          "the building itself looks really nice.takes you to a different era. it's a nice walk around Khmer history and won't take more than an hour to see it all. still the ticket price was a little expensive for what you see and the size of the museum.",

          "The equivalent in Siem Reap is much better, this museum is more just a colllection of sand stone statues with little to know information and minimal historical displays. 10USD entry is very over priced",
          "I was not overly amazed with this museum. The collections were not that large. It was not cheap to buy a ticket. It may be more suited to people with more of a knowledge of Cambodian history.",
          "Great place to visit. I would say it's a must do in Phnom Penh. Beautiful architecture and great indoor garden. A beautiful collection of Buddhist, Brahmin, and Hindu deity statues and relics. It's a good place to take a break.",

          "The museum is in a beautiful old building, but hot inside, so bring a fan. Lots of sculpture, and a pleasant courtyard in the middle. Only one floor and I was hoping to see more old beads and ceramics, but a great place to get a perspective on Khmer History. You can see",

          "The National Museum is definitely for those deeply interested in the history of Khmer art and sculpture. It seemed a bit repetitive for a western observer not used to seeing room after room of ancient artifacts gleaned from ruins throughout Cambodia. It is a beautiful museum",

Peacock dance, Apsara dance, churning if the ocean all were just superb. I was so happy with the cultural show that I attended it for 4 times just to click better pictures.",
          "Nice museum with plenty of natural ventilation during cooler winter afternoons; plenty of rest seating; no photos of some artifacts; admission a bit high for its size, though $5 - 7 would be a fairer price.",
          "A lot to see and experience. You won't fit everything on 1 day but you can always go there for a second round. Every day is a dance show at 3pm and 7pm.",

          "Am interesting hour or so walking around and learning more about the history of Cambodia. Phnom Penh doesn't have too much to see for the average tourist, so you will probably end up here no matter what I write!",
          "For all you history buffs! Lots of statues and sculptures, an excellent selection in fact but you would need to have a real strong interest if you wanted to spend any great deal of time here. The audio guide is an extra $5 and essential, in \u2026",

          "It's a national museum worth visiting. It has a rather large collection of artworks that will enrich your knowledge about ancient Cambodian art after visiting the Angkor Way. Highly recommended!",
          "The ticket to get in was on the more expensive side for Cambodia. There were a lot of really interesting relics to see and an audio explanation if you pay a few USD extra. I especially liked the garden in the middle of the museum with the 4 fish ponds.",

          "Conveniently located and with a beautiful architecture, this museum hosts an interesting collection of  bhuddist statues and artifacts. The audioguides are a bit dry compared to those of the killing fields. I'd recommend to go only after you have donde the killing fields, s1 and wat phnom",
          "This was an neccessary but sad experience, which showed both the brutally/cowardous of man, but also its triumphant spirit to over come and hope in good overcoming evil",

          "A lot of artifacts looted have made their way back here, without prejudice whereas in Angkor wat,  you see the structures!",
          "Don't ever bother! They have seperate pricing policy for foreigners and it is $10!!! Plus $5 for audio, while the museums in Vietnam are around $0.8 - $1.8... Cambodia will never advertise itself well if they continue to see tourists as walking dollars.",

          "A really nice museum, focused largely on Khmer history.",

          "I stayed in a wonderful Airbnb right across from the museum and each night from my balcony i could hear the music from the Cambodian Living Arts Show that is presented each night.  The music called to me and the show was a spectacular \u2026",
          "The best experience I had till date. I couldn't believe myself that I spent nearly 5 hours in such a place. The presentation was brilliant but the highlight is the audio tour, it captured me with its narration of stories, summaries on works \u2026",
          "One of the best place in Cambodia to take a glance at the history of Cambodia. A fan of history and museums, for me it was one of the highlight of my tour to Cambodia.",
          "I was amazed that these relics where just out in the open.  In most museums, they are behind glass or a huge rope is sectioning it off.  It has a nice open area outside where one can relax and take in the view.  My only complaint is the lack of signage on the exterior. It made it a little difficult to find.",

          "Honestly, the price ($10) is a bit steep for this museum. There are plenty of artifacts, but not much as compared with Angkor. There are few labels, so that if you intend to go, I would recommend a guide. The gardens (inside and outside) are the most enjoyable thing. If you are on a tight budget, I would recommend the Palace instead.",

          "I really liked the architecture and the little garden in the middle. But it's 'just' statues and paintings. I expect a National Museum to explain you some history of the nation, this is why I came. 10$ is not worth it in my opinion, just when you are really into art or old things.",

          "Price: USD10\n\nBit underwhelming if you\u2019ve seen Buddhist art museums before. But hang on, there\u2019s a moon rock.\nAlso the art from the Khmer Empire period are pretty cool, if you can imagine being back in that time in history.",

          "Peaceful and relaxing with lots of things to see and also beautiful interior designs of the museum from the inside!",
          "As one of Cambodian I Would say that this is the most famous museum in Cambodia because there are many things for tourists to see about  our country's culture and history. In addition, if you're planning a trip to siemreap, you should check out the Phnom penh national  museum first.",
          "Some interesting pieces but not much in volume",
          "With a 10$ admission fee plus 5$ for the audio guide I expected much more. I believe you can totally skip it after or if you are heading to Angor and Siem Reap.",
          "Did not go in location great near Royal Palace 23",
          "A good museum with plenty information and statue. Help to understand the Khmer's temple period. Better coming early, at 8am, to be cool and quite alone before the tourists' rush. Good place.",

          "It's actually quite good.",
          "Great exhibition threw the history of the Cambodian people from earliest archaeology to present day and all items written in native language and English so no extra expense on a tour guide needed. The building all the items are housed in is \u2026",

          "Interesting museum but the audio guide is probably a good idea as we didn't get it and it  probably would've been quite useful as things are just labelled 'knife' etc.",
          "A lovely museum in a lovely building.",
          "Very long, but interesting museum and exhibition. I don't put a 4 stars just bc I don't like museums so much, furthermore when sun is shining. I visited this one just to be with a friend who like to visit museums.",
          "Expected more of a history museum rather than a detailed exhibition of mostly statues",
          "A great place for a peaceful walk looking at relics from the past of Cambodian: sculptures, statues, everyday appliances during the Angkor and BC era. They have benches where you can sit down and fishes ponds and the food for sale to feed those fishes. \n\nThe roof and building itself showcases a unique Cambodia.",

          "I didn't find this museum worth going to, at least not for the 10 dollar fee plus 5 for audioguide. There are several pre-Angkor statues and miniatures, but unless you have a special interest in Khmer history you might find it a little \u2026",
          "I'd say it's reasonable without being draw dropping but it was 10 quid each which is double what it should cost. Museum in Athens was a good equivalent but only a fiver.",

          "Cool museum, most of the exhibits are statues from the various ancient temples around Cambodia. The placards provide some, but not a whole lot, of information. I would fully recommend the audio tour.\n\nTake note that it can get pretty warm in the museum. Make sure you pack some water before you go!",
          "I enjoyed the audio tour for $15 which included the admission fee of $10.  Lots of artifacts from the last 1,700 years.  No AC and bathrooms we're dirty.  Learned much about historical Cambodian art and religion.",
          "It\u2019s ok. many artefacts inside, though the variety wasn\u2019t huge. Mostly religious archeological statues. One room of paintings which I would have liked more of. The audio guide was pretty tedious and wish I hadn\u2019t bothered. Lots of things \u2026",
          "Nice building, do not waste your time and money inside.",
          "Fairly small but interesting museum.  There isn't a lot of information to read on the artifacts so get the audio guide - it is very extensive!  If you're not familiar with Khmer culture, visit the Angkor National Museum first - it will give you a much better understanding and appreciation when you come here.",

          "Collection of statues and stone carving of Cambodia since pre-Angkor period",
          "The museum itself is quite small, and underwhelming, with only a few (larger) items that stand out. Entrance fee of $10 is double what it should be, and the $5 for the audio tour is made in a way that doesn't cater to casual visitors. There \u2026",
          "My best memory in visiting Cambodia--$15 to join the 90-minutes Traditional Dance  Workshop accompanied with live music and professional dancers, and then I input $20 for watching the breath taking traditional dance show. Very fun weekend.",

          "Must see when visiting Phnom Penh! 10 USD to get in and then 5 USD for the easy to use audio tool that is foolish not to pay extra for as there is not a lot of signage and it provides a wealth of information about the art, history and myths \u2026",

          "i loved this museum....it gives you a very good lesson in how The Khmer Empire shifted from Hinduism to Buddhism.\nI went there after I visited the Killing Fields.\nI was so numb and freaked I needed a calming place to relax and meditate..\nIt will whet your appetite to get up to Siem Reap... for sure..",
          "The court yard in the museum was very nice and colourful. Wouldn't recommend the audio guide - pretty irritating voice and a lot of speculation rather than fact",
          "Worthwhile visiting if you have time. The museum is housed in an attractive building around the four sides of an open air quadrangle with four ponds. Entrance fee is $10 plus $5 for an audio guide. Many artifacts and carvings dating back \u2026",

          "A small museum, compared to Indian museums. Not much to see.",
          "I love their red building! So beautiful. I spent $10 for ticket fee and have to pay $5 for audio guides. They have a lot of statues and things inside. But they need to put them well, one statue to one statue is too close. They might be think about maintanance. But totally, its really worth to visit this museum \ud83d\udc4d",
          "Beautiful  buildings, with different  rooms with statues,antiquities ,buddhas,gardens in the centre of building. Spent 1 hour in this calm place,you can buy audio or hire a guide.\nStopped at cafe after in gardens,very relaxing, smoothie, iced coffee.",
          "Probably the worst museum I've ever been to while travelling. Terribly over priced for what you get, $10 is not worth it at all. It just has a few statues with no explanations really. They are not even great statues. The only saving grace is that the architecture of the building itself is really nice and rhe courtyard is lovely.",
          "Interesting antique exposition.",

          "Nice cafe shop to meeting, relax. A lot natural around us to make feel better in city.",
          "10 usd per person to only see statues seems a bit overpriced. You would think the national museum of cambodia would have much more content",
          "We didn't pay for the guided tour and just went around at our own accord. Well worth the money. It's amazing to see many exhibits showing stuff from way back in times many.of us can't remember. Worth a visit",
          "The price is fairly steep (10 for entry and 5 for an audio guide). Although I understand this goes towards the upkeep of the museum, it is still a large price to pay for the information given. \n\nThe audio guide was fairly good, as many of \u2026",

          "It's a nice place to go and the audio guide is 10 bucks, which is totally a worth. The whole museum is not extended. 1h 30min might cover the whole exhibition. U can also spend as much time as u want, just sitting there listening to the audio guide, knowing better about Khmer art history.",
          "Nothing special. Limited exhibits. $10 entry...and they don't even take credit cards. Not worth the TIME or MONEY.",
          "Overpriced entrance fee for what you are seeing... would skip if your time is limited.",
          "It's a nice but small museum which doesn't consume a lot of time. The audio guide was a waste of money since they only describe what the sculpture looked like instead of telling about the history.",

          "Not very large collection but every exhibit is an exquisite display of Khmer art and sculpture. Some rare frescoes and sculptures such as Parashuram,Ram, Nataraj, Pragyaparamita, Ganeshas and some amazingly intact Buddhas with nagas.",
          "We like to go to museums in the middle of the day when it is very hot to enjoy the ac. There is no ac here which makes wondering around various stone statues with little information very tedious. The show in the evening though was wonderful and worth the visit!",
          "It\u2019s a great opportunity to see the Khmer history and heritage. Hundreds of worthless pieces displayed in one place \ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffc",
          "I saw a show here and it was amazing! A great way to get a glimpse into the culture.",
          "Near Royal Palace, houses a large collection of Khemer art/statues/artifacts. Recommend talking a audio guide - as practically no/v less information is available as description.",
          "Expensive and nearly nothing to see. Worn.",
          "Lots of artifacts some dating BCE\nGet the headset to get a full context.",
          "At the time we went it was $10 USD per foreign adult and $7 USD per child. Fairly small museum. Mostly consists of many variations of stone sculptures of the same things. Interesting brief history of Cambodia. Also has 4 ponds in the center \u2026",
          "Nice building, interesting exhibition",
          "WOW!  So much to see and enjoy you almost should do it in two days, but if your pressed for time you can do it in one with a guided tour.  You have the option to go with a guided tour, audio tour, or self guided.  I would opt for Audio \u2026",
          "Good place to stay.",
          "The museum was priced fair an a total of $15.00 for entrance and audio guide.  The exhibits are well presented but they do not allow photographs taken inside.  I find that it would be a benefit if they did allow with no flash.  They will \u2026",
          "The place you need to know more about Cambodian arts",
          "There are a ton of artifacts to look at and I found it to be interesting. Not a very large museum but if you'd like to see some statues and a bit more about the culture, stop by.",
          "Beautiful museum with lots of old statue n other things.",
          "I like the cafe inside. You dont have to pay the adminssion fee as long as you stay outside of the building.",
          "Sadly, a very underwhelming museum. Not worth the entrance fee. Go to Siem Reap and visit the temples themselves for a far richer experience.",
          "Extensive collection of Khmer artifacts, sculptures, etc. The entrance fee is 10USD unlike the 5USD specified in some articles or blogs but it's worth it. They have a beautiful garden in the centre that on its own, justifies the entrance fee I believe.",
          "The best place to stufy about khmer culture",
          "Artifacts are great",
          "For museum like this ticket is expensive and if you want to make the most of it need to buy the tour guide which is additional $5. I enjoyed some part and was helpful but got bored in the end, so unless you're really into the history and sculptures, I wouldn't say it's a must go in the city.",
          "The audio is informative and museum  is great.Worth to visit in order to learn more about the stories behind the statues from Angkor and Cambodian ancient history. You can  check the statues closely.Tips for visiting the museum :check out \u2026",
          "A treasure trove for history buffs. The museum has loads of artefacts from ancient era. Go for it if you are in Phnom Penh.",
          "This place stored so many history khmer evidences. This place is good for reseach Khme' s cultures.",
          "Not worth the money! If you can just skip it, the building inside looks more impressive than the content inside.",
          "The architecture of the building and the courtyard are absolutely beautiful. Most of the exhibits are similar to what we\u2019ve seen at other museums in Cambodia, and it doesn\u2019t compare in size to the Angkor Museum in Siem Reap\u2014but, it does include some more modern artifacts.",
          "Very authentic place must see",
          "A relatively steep entry fee of $5 for foreigners allows you to peruse the whole place alone. With an indoor courtyard with coy ponds, groomed shrubbery and surrounding statues, the interior is quite beautiful. Statues and artifacts fill \u2026",
          "Entrance fee is to expensive(cost USD 10). I think I'm ts not worth it. Have to rent the phone to know all the item in the museum. You can't even understand the think if you didn't rent it.",
          "Splendid visit if you want to see some old rocks and sculptures.",
          "It is one of the most important attractions which is a must visit place in Phnom Penh. The museum contained all long history of Cambodia, religions, and how Cambodian in the history fought in war.",
          "Many interesting exhibits with a strong focus on the sculpture and architecture within Cambodia's history.",
          "Very interesting, but most pieces in the museum are (largely incomplete)statues of Hindu deities. It was very hot in the building, which made it uncomfortable for the kids. Must take the digital voice tour to provide context as the cards aren't always packed with information. Overall a good experience.",
          "It is a beautiful museum. The entrance cost with audio guide is $10. If you are into artefact this is the place.",
          "It's more like a gallery than a museum. Nothing to learn about the country",
          "Definitely worth seeing amazing articles of Buddhist and Hindu culture",
          "Beautiful place",
          "A must visit for any tourist to get a background on Cambodian history and culture, not available anywhere else. Also tranquil atmosphere.",
          "Nice museum if you want to see statues and artifact from the Khmer empire. It is 10$ for tourist.",
          "Though the collection is around 1000 artifacts  , it's arranged and maintained well. You get the headsets to know about each one displayed in the  museum. # only the fonts of the description must be bigger to felicitate for reading.",
          "It was a very beautiful museum with nice cultural diversity and place. It\u2019s about human nature of generations in moderation.",

          "Lovely architecture.",
          "It is expencive for what is is. The curator didn't do a good job in this one. Can improve. Seam Reap museum it's way better and more complete than this one.",
          "Good experience with kid and family. Good thing is we can have some statues copy with a good price. I think for only some particular items..",
          "I hoped the museum would provide insight into the history of Cambodia but unfortunately I did not find it overly informative. There are lots of statues and artefacts with information if you get the audio tour but it\u2019s very repetitive.",
          "It's a beautiful building, but realistically beyond that, the sculptures aren't really worth the $10. But maybe it's because we didn't get the audio guide. \nIf you are into religion (Buddhism and Hinduism in particular) this would be a great museum for you",
          "Quite a disappointing museum overall, not worth the 10 USD ticket price as the exhibits were poorly arranged with minimal information available unless visitors spend an extra 5 USD for the audio guide.\n\nA lot of exhibits were Buddhist \u2026",
          "Building is incredible. Audio narration is very informative. Could spend hours wandering here. Really beautiful.",
          "A beautiful collection of Buddhist, Brahmin, and Hindu deity statues and relics. I'm going to assume that with the audio guide this could have been a fruitful experience, but at $10 for entrance I couldn't be bothered to splurge. If you're \u2026",
          "Every Indian must visit this place.",
          "The collections of khmer artifacts are great but i think the building itself is the main attraction. I love the contrast between the striking red walls and the lush green of the gardens and inner courtyards. Great place for pictures. And \u2026",
          "It is the largest museum of cultural history including sculptures, ceramics, ethnographic objects, etc. from the prehistoric period to the Khmer Empire. \nThe buildings were built between 1917 and 1924. \nIt is under the guidance of the Cambodian Ministry of Culture and Fine Arts.\nEntrance is 10 USD per person.",
          "You have to go there its a must . An archaeological dream . Kids and adults will be amazed at the deep ancient history on display . It is a place you can spend hours upon hours . I felt like I was on my own Indiana Jones tour . One of the \u2026",
          "Was expecting more, but didn't see much more than many different statues of Buddha. Maybe would have gotten more out of it if I had rented the audio guide.",
          "Nothing much to shout about",
          "Beautiful structure, perfectly explained by the audio guide you rent at the entrance",
          "If you like antics and ancient stuff. This is the right place.",
          "For a museum personally I\u2019ve been to better, anyways it\u2019s good tourist spot to check the list, I\u2019d rather skip this place and go straight to the royal palace cause it\u2019s like a big museum as well. I recommend booking the ticket to the show it\u2019s good and get the better seats cause it\u2019s about an hour and half so idk up to you.",
          "Alot smaller than i expected but was ok. Could do with alot more like history of currency and the day to day life of this amazing country and its history.",
          "Nice place. But you can't spend whole day here. Ticket price is 10$ for foreigners. If you buy audio guide that's need extra charge. Overall you will enjoy that place.",
          "I was fairly disappointed by this museum. It is very small, and 90% is ocupied by broken statues. Not may stories to read. The walls are dirty. Worst spent 10 dollars.",
          "loved the show...would highly recommend to anyone...gives you a new appreciation  for the cambodian heritage",
          "Great place to visit and got more details about history",
          "Lots of beautiful artifacts. I wish the museum was better organized and displayed and it should be one of the best museums in Asia.",
          "It has many history stories to enjoy and read",
          "Ateended evening folk dance there only. Great dancers beautiful costumes & dances but it is a smallish theatre I enjoyed a front row privilage but I could do with middle or last row as well. Better pay less for ticket and put in a 5$ contribution at the end. Enjoy.",
          "A must visit lots to see and learn about Cambodians history and culture,",
          "For such a heritage rich country it is interesting how small the public collections are, especially the prehistoric material. Lovely quiet seclusion from hustle of Phnom Penh though.",
          "Wonderful displays of Khmer millenial culture",
          "The outside is pretty impressive as compared to the inside which were mostly Siddharta stone sculptures. Photo-taking is not allowed inside the National Museum unless you pay. The museum is not that huge. I probably had a higher expectation.",
          "It's 5$ for entry and 5$ for the audio guide. The museum is not too extensive but houses quite a few showstoppers like the 6ft Vishnu Bronze from Angkor. The audio guide while informative might be too detailed for most people. You can take a 1$ pass to take photographs inside the museum. ",
          "The location of the National Museum of Cambodia is very convenient and accessible to the general public. The entrance fee is a bit expensive but the museum houses many of the important artifacts that forms part of the great cambodian \u2026",
          "A good introduction to Khmer history, but a bit overpriced. If you're going to Angkor Wat, I'd give this a miss and go to the museum in Siem Reap instead, which has a far better layout, more detailed information and more interesting things to see.",
          "Very important place for cambodia to share our history to foreign countries.",
          "This museum gives you a sneak into the fine art of ancient Cambodian before you eventual visit of Angkor Wat in Siem Reap",
          "Took the audio guide but $10 (ticket) + $5 (audio)is kind of steep. I didn\u2019t like the intro music for every item I clicked as I rather hear the explanation quickly. Also they asked for passports for youths. Of course the kids don\u2019t carry \u2026",
          "At $10 entrance fee per person, I found the price to be very steep for what was on display. There are many statues and tablets with inscriptions along with some weapons and items of daily use in historical times. Nevertheless the building was beautiful and I did enjoy learning more about Cambodia\u2019s history.",
          "Amazing experience",
          "No AC and the audioguide is so so. There's so much room for improvement...",
          "Great place to learn about the symbols and history which are used in the temples you will see (i.e. Angkor Wat). Guided tour presents a lot of information, but lost my interest after a while.",
          "Small but what they have is incredible.",
          "Interesting view into Cambodias history",
          "This is a really relaxed museum. The building is very beautiful with a lovely garden in the centre. The various statues and carvings are astounding, with detailed information available.\nI did not get an audioguide and ended up staying about 1hr. \nThis museum really highlights how advanced and powerful the Angkor Kingdom was. ",
          "The center of Cambodian archaeological preservation and exhibition. Easily accessed. Really crowded with students and tourists. It provides audio-guide. The collections are mostly archaeological. The building itself is a museum collection; beautiful and grandeur."

Phnom Penh has been the national capital since French colonization of Cambodia, and has grown to become the nation's economic, industrial, and cultural center.\nOnce known as the \"Pearl of Asia,\" it was considered one of the loveliest French-built cities in Indochina in the 1920s. Phnom Penh, along with Siem Reap and Sihanoukville, are significant global and domestic tourist destinations for Cambodia. Founded in 1372, the city is noted for its historical architecture and attractions. It became the national capital in 1434 following the fall of Angkor, and remained so until 1497. It regained its capital status during the French colonial era in 1865. There are a number of surviving French colonial buildings scattered along the grand boulevards.\nOn the banks of the Tonl\u00e9 Sap, Mekong, and Bassac Rivers, Phnom Penh is home to more than 2 million people, approximately 14% of the Cambodian population.\n\n\n== Etymology ==\nPhnom Penh (literally, 'Penh's Hill') takes its name from the present Wat Phnom ('Hill Temple'). Legend has it that in 1372, a wealthy widow named Lady Penh found a Koki tree floating down the Tonle Sap river after a storm. Inside the tree were four bronze Buddha statues and a stone statue of Vishnu. Daun Penh ordered villagers to raise the height of the hill northeast of her house and used the Koki wood to build a temple on the hill to house the four Buddha statues, and a shrine for the Vishnu image slightly lower down. The temple became known as Wat Phnom Daun Penh, which is now known as Wat Phnom, a small hill 27 metres (89 ft) in height.\nPhnom Penh's official name, in its short form, is Krong Chaktomok (Khmer: \u1780\u17d2\u179a\u17bb\u1784\u1785\u178f\u17bb\u1798\u17bb\u1781) meaning \"City of Four Faces\".

This loosely translates as \"The place of four rivers that gives the happiness and success of Khmer Kingdom, the highest leader as well as impregnable city of the God Indra of the great kingdom\".\n\n\n== History ==\nFirst recorded a century after it is said to have taken place, the legend of the founding of Phnom Penh tells of a local woman, Penh (commonly referred to as Daun Penh (\"Grandmother Penh\" or \"Old Lady Penh\") in Khmer), living at Chaktomuk, the future Phnom Penh. It was the late 14th century, and the Khmer capital was still at Angkor near Siem Reap 350 km (217 mi) to the north. Gathering firewood along the banks of the river, Lady Penh spied a floating koki tree in the river and fished it from the water. Inside the tree she found four Buddha statues and one of Vishnu.\nThe discovery was taken as a divine blessing, and to some a sign that the Khmer capital was to be brought to Phnom Penh from Angkor. To house the new-found sacred objects, Penh raised a small hill on the west bank of the Tonle Sap River and crowned it with a shrine, now known as Wat Phnom at the north end of central Phnom Penh. \"Phnom\" is Khmer for \"hill\" and Penh's hill took on the name of the founder, and the area around it became known after the hill.\nPhnom Penh first became the capital of Cambodia after Ponhea Yat, king of the Khmer Empire, moved the capital from Angkor Thom after it was captured and destroyed by Siam a few years earlier. There is a stupa behind Wat Phnom that houses the remains of Ponhea Yat and the royal family as well as the remaining Buddhist statues from the Angkorean era. In the 17th century, Japanese immigrants also settled on the outskirts of present-day Phnom Penh. A small Portuguese community survived in Phnom Penh until the 17th century, undertaking commercial and religious activity in the country.\nPhnom Penh remained the royal capital for 73 years, from 1432 to 1505. It was abandoned for 360 years (from 1505 to 1865) by subsequent kings due to internal fighting between the royal pretenders. Later kings moved the capital several times and established their royal capitals at various locations in Tuol Basan (Srey Santhor), Pursat, Longvek, Lavear Em and Oudong.\nIt was not until 1866, under the reign of King Norodom I (1860\u20131904), the eldest son of King Ang Duong, who ruled on behalf of Siam, that Phnom Penh became the permanent seat of government and capital of Cambodia, and also where the current Royal Palace was built. Beginning in 1870, the French colonial authorities turned a riverside village into a city where they built hotels, schools, prisons, barracks, banks, public works offices, telegraph offices, law courts, and health services buildings. In 1872, the first glimpse of a modern city took shape when the colonial administration employed the services of French contractor Le Faucheur to construct the first 300 concrete houses for sale and rental to Chinese traders.\nBy the 1920s, Phnom Penh was known as the \"Pearl of Asia\", and over the next four decades, Phnom Penh continued to experience rapid growth with the building of railways to Sihanoukville and Pochentong International Airport (now Phnom Penh International Airport). Phnom Penh's infrastructure saw major modernisation under the rule of Sihanouk.During the Vietnam War, Cambodia was used as a base by the People's Army of Vietnam (PAVN) and the Viet Cong (VC) and thousands of refugees from across the country flooded the city to escape the fighting between their own government troops, the PAVN/VC, the South Vietnamese and its allies and the Khmer Rouge and the American air strikes. By 1975, the population was 2\u20133 million, the bulk of whom were refugees from the fighting. The Khmer Rouge cut off supplies to the city for more than a year before it fell on April 17, 1975. Reports from journalists stated that the Khmer Rouge shelling \"tortured the capital almost continuously,\" inflicting \"random death and mutilation\" on millions of trapped civilians. The Khmer Rouge forcibly evacuated the entire city after taking it, in what has been described as a death march: Fran\u00e7ois Ponchaud wrote that \"I shall never forget one cripple who had neither hands nor feet, writhing along the ground like a severed worm, or a weeping father carrying his ten-year old daughter wrapped in a sheet tied around his neck like a sling, or the man with his foot dangling at the end of a leg to which it was attached by nothing but skin\"; Jon Swain recalled that the Khmer Rouge were \"tipping out patients from the hospitals like garbage into the streets....In five years of war, this is the greatest caravan of human misery I have seen.\" All of its residents, including the wealthy and educated, were evacuated from the city and forced to do difficult labour on rural farms as \"new people\". Tuol Sleng High School was taken over by Pol Pot's forces and was turned into the S-21 prison camp, where people were detained and tortured. Pol Pot sought a return to an agrarian economy and therefore killed many people perceived as educated, \"lazy\" or political enemies. Many others starved to death as a result of failure of the agrarian society and the sale of Cambodia's rice to China in exchange for bullets and weaponry. The former high school is now the Tuol Sleng Genocide Museum, where Khmer Rouge torture devices and photos of their victims are displayed. Choeung Ek (The Killing Fields), 15 kilometers (9 mi) away, where the Khmer Rouge marched prisoners from Tuol Sleng to be murdered and buried in shallow pits, is also now a memorial to those who were killed by the regime.\nThe Khmer Rouge were driven out of Phnom Penh by the PAVN in 1979, and people began to return to the city. Vietnam is historically a state with which Cambodia has had many conflicts, therefore this liberation was and is viewed with mixed emotions by the Cambodians. A period of reconstruction began, spurred by the continuing stability of government, attracting new foreign investment and aid by countries including France, Australia, and Japan. Loans were made from the Asian Development Bank and the World Bank to reinstate a clean water supply, roads and other infrastructure. The 1998 Census put Phnom Penh's population at 862,000; and the 2008 census was 1.3 million.\n\n\n== Geography ==\nPhnom Penh is in the south-central region of Cambodia, and is fully surrounded by Kandal Province. The municipality is on the banks of the Tonl\u00e9 Sap, Mekong, and Bassac Rivers. These rivers provide freshwater and other natural resources to the city. Phnom Penh and the surrounding areas consist of a typical flood plain area for Cambodia. Although Phnom Penh is at 11.89 metres (39 ft) above the river, monsoon season flooding is a problem, and the river sometimes overflows its banks.\nThe city, at 11.55\u00b0N 104.91667\u00b0E\ufeff / 11.55; 104.91667 (11\u00b033' North, 104\u00b055' East), covers an area of 678.46 square kilometres (262 sq mi), with some 11,401 hectares (28,172 acres) in the municipality and 26,106 ha (64,509 acres) of roads. The agricultural land in the municipality amounts to 34.685 km2 (13 sq mi) with some 1.476 km2 (365 acres) under irrigation.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nPhnom Penh has a tropical wet and dry climate (K\u00f6ppen climate classification Aw). The climate is hot year-round with only minor variations. Temperatures typically range from 22 to 35 \u00b0C (72 to 95 \u00b0F) and weather is subject to the tropical monsoons. The southwest monsoon blows inland bringing moisture-laden winds from the Gulf of Thailand and Indian Ocean from May to November. The northeast monsoon ushers in the dry season, which lasts from December to April. The city experiences the heaviest precipitation from September to October with the driest period in January and February.\nThe city has two distinct seasons. The rainy season, which runs from May to November, sees high temperatures accompanied by high humidity. The dry season lasts from December to April; when overnight temperatures can drop to 22 \u00b0C (72 \u00b0F).\n\n\n== Administration ==\n\nPhnom Penh is a municipality of area 678.46 square kilometres (261.95 sq mi) with a government status equal to that of Cambodian provinces. The municipality is divided into 14 administrative divisions called khans (sections). The sections are subdivided into 105 sangkats (quarters), and further subdivided into 953 phums (villages).  All khans are under the governance of the Phnom Penh Municipality. Dangkao, Meanchey, Porsenchey, Sen Sok and Russei Keo are considered the outskirts of the city.\nThe municipality is governed by the governor who acts as the top executive of the city as well as overseeing the Municipal Military Police, Municipal Police, and Bureau of Urban Affairs. Below the governor is the first vice governor and five vice governors. The chief of cabinet, who holds the same status as the vice governors, heads the cabinet consisting of eight deputy chiefs of cabinet who in turn are in charge of the 27 administrative departments. Every khan (district) also has a chief.\n\n\n== Demographics ==\nAs of 2019, Phnom Penh had a population of 2,129,371 people, with a total population density of 3,136 inhabitants per square kilometre in a 679 square kilometres (262 sq mi) city area. The population growth rate of the city is 3.92%. The city area has grown fourfold since 1979, and the metro area will continue to expand in order to support the city's growing population and economy.\nPhnom Penh is mostly inhabited by Cambodians (or Khmers). They represent 90% of the population of the city. There are large minorities of Chinese, Vietnamese, and other small ethnic groups who are Thai, Budong, Mnong Preh, Kuy, Chong, and Chams. The state religion is Theravada Buddhism. More than 90% of the people in Phnom Penh are Buddhists. Chams have been practicing Islam for hundreds of years. Since 1993, there has also been an increase in the practice of Christianity which was practically wiped out after 1975 when the Khmer Rouge took over. The official language is Khmer, but English and French are widely used in the city.\nThe number of slum-inhabitants at the end of 2012 was 105,771, compared with 85,807 at the start of 2012.Note: As stated in the \"History\" paragraph (The 1998 Census put Phnom Penh's population at 862,000; and the 2008 census was 1.3 million.) the information collides with the information provided in the \"Historical population\" table. Needs editing.\n\n\n== Politics ==\n\n \nPhnom Penh is allocated 12 seats in the National Assembly, making it the largest constituency.\n\n\n=== Members of Parliament ===\n\n\n== Economy ==\n\nPhnom Penh is Cambodia's economic centre as it accounts for a large portion of the Cambodian economy. Double-digit economic growth rates in recent years have triggered an economic boom in Phnom Penh, with new hotels, restaurants, schools, bars, high rises and residential buildings springing up in the city.\nThe economy is based on commercial interests such as garments, trading, and small and medium enterprises. In the past few years the property business has been booming, with rapidly increasing real estate prices. Tourism is also a major contributor in the capital as more shopping and commercial centres open, making Phnom Penh one of the major tourist destinations in South East Asia along with Siem Reap and Sihanoukville. According to the World Travel and Tourism Council, tourism made up 19.2 percent (US$2,053 million) of Cambodia's GDP in 2009 and accounts for 13.7 percent of total employment. One of the most popular areas in Phnom Penh for tourists is Sisowath Quay, alongside the Tonle Sap River. Sisowath Quay is a five kilometre strip of road that includes restaurants, bars, and hotels.The US$2.6 billion new urban development, Camko City, is meant to bolster the city landscape. The Bureau of Urban Affairs of Pnochina Penh Municipality has plans to expand and construct new infrastructure to accommodate the growing population and economy. High rise buildings will be chinesely constructed at the entrance of the city and near the lakes and riverbanks. Furthermore, new roads, canals, and a railway system will be used to connect Camko City and Phnom Penh.\nOther projects include:\n\nGrand Phnom Penh International City (under construction)\nDe Castle Royal Condominium (Completed)\nGold Tower 42 (On hold 32 floors construction begins again in the mid of 2018)\nOCIC Tower (Completed)\nKokling super second floor house\nVattanac Capital Tower (completed)\nThe Bridge (Completed)\nThe Peak (under construction)\nWith booming economic growth seen since the 1990s, new shopping venues have opened: Sorya Center Point, Aeon Mall Phnom Penh, Aeon Mall Sen Sok City, Olympia Mall, and Parkson Mall (under construction). Many international brands have opened such as Mango, Salvatore Ferragamo, Hugo Boss, Padini Concept Store, Lily, Timberland, Jimmy Choo, CC Double O, MO, Brands Outlet, Nike, Converse, Pony, Armani Exchange, and Super Dry.\nThe tallest skyscraper in Phnom Penh is Vattanac Capital Tower at a height of 188 metres (617 ft), dominating Phnom Penh's skyline with its neighbour skyscraper Canadia Tower (OCIC Tower). The tower was completed in December 2014. Modern high rises have been constructed all around the city, not concentrated in any one particular area.\nThe Central Market Phsar Thmei is a tourist attraction. The four wings of the yellow colored market are teeming with numerous stalls selling gold and silver jewelry, antique coins, clothing, clocks, flowers, food, fabrics and shoes. Phsar Thmei is undergoing under a major renovation, along with the creation of newer stalls.\n\n\n== Education ==\n\n\n=== Universities and colleges ===\n\n\n=== Primary and secondary schools ===\n\n\n=== International schools ===\n\n\n=== Supplementary and extra schools ===\nThe Japanese Supplementary School of Phnom Penh , formerly known in English as the Phnom Penh Japanese School, is a part-time Japanese School, operated by the Japanese Association of Cambodia (JACAM;\u30ab\u30f3\u30dc\u30b8\u30a2\u65e5\u672c\u4eba\u4f1a Kambojia Nihonjin-kai). It is in Sangkat Toek Thla in Sen Sok. It was established in 2002. It had 60 students in June 2011.\n\n\n== Culture ==\nPhnom Penh also has its own dialect of Khmer. Speakers of the Phnom Penh dialect often elide syllables, which has earned it the reputation for being lazy speech. Phnom Penh is also known for its influence on New Khmer Architecture. Phnom Penh is notable for Ka tieu Phnom Penh, its variation on rice noodle soup, a dish available in sit-down cafes as well as street cafes.\nMusic and the arts are making a revival throughout Cambodia, especially in Phnom Penh. Phnom Penh currently hosts a number of music events throughout the city. 'Indie' bands (those without corporate sponsors) have grown in number due also in part to the emergence of private music schools such as SoundsKool Music (also operating in the city of Siem Reap), and Music Arts School (registered as an NGO).\nThe two most visited museums in the city are the National Museum, which is the country's leading historical and archaeological museum, and Tuol Sleng Genocide Museum, a former Khmer Rouge prison. The National Museum hosts celebrations of Cambodian dance and music, including a popular classic Apsara dance show of traditional folk dances as well as original creations.\nChaul Chnam Thmey April 13\u201315\n\nAt this time, Phnom Penh celebrates Cambodian New Year, an occasion increasingly popular with tourists. During this typically hottest part of the year, water gets thrown around adding to the party atmosphere along with dancing and music. The precise date changes year-by-year but this holiday lasts, at least, three days. This festival marks the turn of the year based on the ancient Khmer calendar and also marks the end of the prior year harvest.\nWater Festival November\n\nThe largest annual festival in Phnom Penh, this lively gathering celebrates the reversing of the flow of the Tonl\u00e9 Sap River. The holiday lasts three days as people flood into the city to enjoy the fireworks, boat races, live concerts, eating and partying. The boat racing dates back to ancient times marking the strengths of the Khmer marine forces during the Khmer Empire.\nOn 22 November 2010 at least 348 people were crushed to death in a bridge stampede at the festival.Pchum Ben October 11\u201315 (2012)\nPchum Ben is a very important aspect of Cambodian culture. It may be translated as \"gathering together\" to make offerings and is a time of reunion, commemoration, express love and appreciation for one's ancestors. By offering food and good karma to those possibly trapped in the spirit world, living relatives help assuage their misery and guide them back into the cycle of reincarnation.\nVisak Bochea May\n\nVes\u0101kha is an annual holiday observed traditionally by Buddhists in Cambodia. Sometimes informally called \"Buddha's Birthday\", it actually encompasses the birth, enlightenment (nirv\u0101\u1e47a), and passing away (Parinirv\u0101na) of Gautama Buddha.\n\n\n== Cityscape and architecture ==\n\nThe oldest structure is Wat Phnom from the founding days of the city, constructed in 1373. The main tourist attractions are the Royal Palace with the Silver Pagoda, and the National Museum, constructed during the French colonial era in the late-19th century in the classical Khmer style and hosting a vast collection of Khmer antiquities. The Independence Monument (Khmer: Vimean Akareach), although from the 1950s, is also constructed in the ancient Khmer style.\nThe French, who were the colonial masters from the 19th century to the 1940s, also left their mark, with various colonial villas, French churches, boulevards, and the Art Deco market Phsar Thom Thmei. A notable landmark of the colonial era is the Hotel Le Royal.\n\nStarting with independence from the French in the 1950s and lasting until the era of the Khmer Rouge in the 1970s, Phnom Penh underwent tremendous growth as the capital city of a newly independent country. King Sihanouk was eager to present a new style of architecture and thus invigorate the process of nation building. A new golden era of architecture took off, with various projects and young Khmer architects, often educated in France, given opportunities to design and construct. This new movement was called \"New Khmer Architecture\" and was often characterised by a fusion of Bauhaus, European post-modern architecture, and traditional elements from Angkor. The most prominent architect was Vann Molyvann, who was nominated chief national architect by the king himself in 1956. Molyvann created landmark buildings such as the Preah Suramarit National Theatre and the Council of Ministers building. Other architects helped construct the newly founded Royal Khmer University, the Institute of Foreign Languages, and the National Sports Centre. With the growth of the upper and entrepreneurial middle classes, new suburbs were built in the 1950s and 1960s. Although these buildings survived the Khmer Rouge era and the civil war, today they are under threat due to economic development and financial speculation. Villas and gardens from that era are being destroyed and redeveloped to make place for bigger structures. The landmark National Theatre by Molyvann was razed in 2008. A movement is rising in Cambodia to preserve this modernist heritage. Old villas are sometimes being converted into boutique hotels, such as the Knai Bang Chatt. \nMonuments and memorials to the genocide of the Khmer Rouge era in the 1970s are the Tuol Sleng Genocide Museum (a former high school used as a concentration camp) and, on the outskirts of the city, the Choeung Ek Genocide Center. The Cambodia-Vietnam Friendship Monument was commissioned by the Vietnamese communists as symbol of Khmer-Vietnamese friendship during the late-1970s following the liberation of Cambodia from the Khmer Rouge.\nThe population, foreign investment, and urban development in Phnom Penh grew dramatically during the 1990s and early-2000s. The rapid growth resulted in the city's infrastructure distinctly lacking (the drainage system is particularly notorious, and Phnom Penh frequently floods during the wet season), and a need for both residential and commercial spaces. The simultaneous demand for residential and commercial housing and the increase of international investment has led to the planning, if not construction, of several satellite cities. The largest of these cities are: Grand Phnom Penh International City, CamKo City, Diamond Island City, Boeung Kak Town, and Chruy Cangva City.\nOn the outskirts of the city, farmland has been developed into garment factories and housing for lower economic classes and those displaced by the new development in the city center.\n\n\n=== 2035 master plan ===\nOriginally intended to be completed by 2020, the 2035 master plan is a French-funded project for the development of Phnom Penh. Although the plan was approved by the Ministry of Land Management, Urban Planning and Construction in 2005, it has yet to be ratified by the Cabinet of Cambodia. The original plan details five edge-city projects connected to the historical city centre by waterways and tree-lined corridors.\n\n\n== Media ==\n\n\n=== Dailies ===\n\n\n==== Khmer ====\nSralagn' Khmer (Love Khmer)\nChakraval Daily (Universe)\nKampuchea Thmei Daily (New Cambodia)\nKampuchea Tgnai Nis (Cambodia Today)\nKanychok Sangkhum (Social Reflection)\nKoh Santepheap (Island of Peace)\nMoneaksekar Khmer (Khmer Conscience) \u2013 Published by the Sam Rainsy Party.\nRasmei Kampuchea (Light of Kampuchea) \u2013 Cambodia's largest daily, it circulates about 18,000 copies.\nSamleng Yuvachun (Voice of Khmer Youth)\nUdomkate Khmer (Khmer Ideal)\nWat Phnom Daily (Mount Temple)\n\n\n==== English ====\nPhnom Penh Post, a daily English-language newspaper published in Phnom Penh.\nThe Cambodia Daily, an English-language daily newspaper (closed in 2017).\nThe Khmer Times, an English-language daily newspaper.\n\n\n==== Chinese ====\n\u300a\u67ec\u83ef\u65e5\u5831\u300b(Jianhua Daily), a daily Chinese-language newspaper published in Phnom Penh.\n\u300a\u661f\u6d32\u65e5\u5831\u300b(Sin Chew Daily), a Chinese-language daily newspaper, the Cambodian edition of the Malaysian Chinese daily of the same name.\n\u300a\u83ef\u5546\u65e5\u5831\u300b(Huashang Daily), a Chinese-language daily newspaper.\n\u300a\u9ad8\u68c9\u65e5\u62a5\u300b(Khmer Daily), a Chinese-language daily newspaper.\n\u300a\u65b0\u67ec\u57d4\u5be8\u300b(New Cambodia), a Chinese-language daily newspaper.\n\n\n=== Magazines ===\nAsiaLIFE Guide Phnom Penh, a monthly English-language lifestyle magazine published in Phnom Penh.\nPocket Guide Cambodia publishes four separate guides aimed at English-speaking residents and visitors.\nF Magazine, the first fashion-forward magazine in Cambodia.

Cambodia has increasingly become involved in modern sports over the last 30 years. As with the rest of the country, football and the martial arts are particularly popular.  Ultimate fighting and freestyle boxing have also become more common in recent years.The most prominent sporting venue in the city is the Phnom Penh National Olympic Stadium with a capacity of 80,000\u2014although the country never hosted the Olympic Games due to disruption by the civil war and the Khmer Rouge in the 1970s. Built in 1964, it is home to the Cambodian national football team. On completion the stadium was one of the largest in Asia. Today it is the 6th largest stadium in Southeast Asia. Volleyball, basketball, and Tai-Kwon-Do games are often hosted at the stadium.  The stadium closed in 2000, but was redeveloped and reopened.\nThe National Sports Centre of Cambodia hosts swimming, boxing, and volleyball competitions. Noted local football clubs include Phnom Penh Empire, Khemara Keila FC and Military Police.\n\n\n== Transport ==\n\nPhnom Penh International Airport is the largest and busiest airport in Cambodia. It is seven kilometres west of central Phnom Penh. The airport is connected to the city center by taxi, train, and shuttle bus.\nCambodia's national flag carrier, Cambodia Angkor Air, launched in 2009, is headquartered in Phnom Penh and has its main hub there, with an additional hub at the Angkor International Airport.Air France used to serve Phnom Penh from Paris-Charles de Gaulle but this service has since stopped. Qatar Airways now flies to and from Phnom Penh, via Ho Chi Minh City.\nTaxis, pick-ups, and minibuses leave the city for destinations all over the country, but are fast losing ground to cheaper and more comfortable buses. Phnom Penh also has a rail service.\nThere are numerous bus companies, including Phnom Penh Public Transport and GST Express, running services to most provincial capitals, including Sihanoukville, Kampong Chhnang, Oudong and Tak\u00e9o. Phnom Penh Sorya Transport Co. offers bus service to several provincial destinations along the National Routes and to Ho Chi Minh City. Giant Ibis is another bus company based in Phnom Penh, which travels to Sihanoukville, Kampot, Siem Reap and Ho Chi Minh, and has free Wi-Fi, air conditioning and modest pricing.\nThe city is Cambodia's main freshwater port, a major port on the Mekong River. It is linked to the South China Sea, 290 kilometres distant, via a channel of the Mekong in Vietnam.\n\n\n=== Public transport ===\n\nPhnom Penh is served by three air conditioned bus lines. Initial attempts by the Japanese government to develop a Phnom Penh bus service began in 2001. An update of the JICA urban transport master plan for Phnom Penh was completed and implemented in 2014. The city is now served by three bus lines, operated by the Phnom Penh municipal government. Private transportation within the city include the cycle rickshaw, known in Khmer as \"cyclo\", the motorcycle taxi known in Khmer as \"moto\", the auto rickshaw known locally as \"tuk-tuk\", the trailer attached to a motorcycle taxi known in Khmer as \"remorque\", and the standard automobile taxicab known in Khmer as \"taxi\". Private forms of transportation used by locals include bicycles, motorbikes, and cars.\n\n\n=== Highways ===\n\nAs the capital of Cambodia, a number of national highways connect the city with various parts of the country:\n\n\n== Water supply ==\n\nWater supply in Phnom Penh has improved dramatically in terms of access, service quality, efficiency, cost recovery and governance between 1993 and 2006. The number of customers has increased ninefold, service quality has improved from intermittent to continuous supply, water losses have been cut dramatically and the city's water utility went from being bankrupt to making a modest profit. These achievements were recognized through international awards such as the 2006 Ramon Magsaysay Award and the 2010 Stockholm Industry Water Award. The city's water utility is the Phnom Penh Water Supply Authority (PPWSA). Its main water sources are the Mekong River, the Tonle Sap river and the Tonle Bassac river.\n\n\n== International relations ==\n\n\n=== Twin towns and sister cities ===\nPhnom Penh is twinned with:\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of markets in Phnom Penh\nSpecial Economic Zones of Cambodia\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\nGroslier, B.P.

          "Our initial thought was that Wat Phnom was distant apart. However, given it was too close to our Hotel, we were happy to visit this first. Amongst various options, this is worth a visit especially for the arrangements inside. A calm, relaxing place.",

          "Beautiful temple located on the top of the hill . The color pallet inside is stunning . Definitely visit it !",
          "A peaceful temple close to the centre hub of the city. Foreigners are charged $1 entry which is for nothing. I spent 25-30 minutes here it\u2019s worth a trip if you have an hour to kill. TUK TUK drovers outside are the only problem as usual in Phnom Penh",
          "Tranquil grounds at the temple. The city might be 100m away, but this felt a serene and peaceful venue. No hawkers within the Wat contributed. Worth the dollar entry.",

          "This was a cool little find. The entry was 1 dollar per person and I think that only applies to foreigners. The temple at the top of the steps was really beautiful, and had a few people playing music while we were there. The giant clock was also pretty cool!",

          "Being right in the middle of Phnom Penh this is an easy Wat to visit with lots of steps for your daily exercise. Good views are in short supply but the beautiful golden Buddha is worth the effort. Very impactfully, there is a tree at the bottom of the steps on the opposite",

          "This Wat was cool. There are a number of stairs so he prepared for that. You have to take off your shoes if you go inside but there are stairs/things to lean against if you need a bit of support to get your shoes back on. There's a small shop complex at the bottom behind it",
          "We chanced upon this in our travels and as Westerners we were charged US$1 to walk around it. It's okay, I wouldn't go out of my way to visit it though.",

          "Beautiful place and surroundings, however not my favorite place to visit are you are hassled to give money every 5 minutes which is not normal for a temple... so they use it as tourist attraction when it should be free and on donation only.... in the end way too many tourists",

          "We visited early in the morning paid 3 bucks to get there from Palace Gate hotel, and then went onto the central market for 2 more. You climb some steps and when you get to the top you won't be disappointed, it's really only 30 min max visit but worth it.",

        "wiki": "The Royal Palace (Khmer: \u1796\u17d2\u179a\u17c7\u1794\u179a\u1798\u179a\u17b6\u1787\u179c\u17b6\u17c6\u1784\u1793\u17c3\u1796\u17d2\u179a\u17c7\u179a\u17b6\u1787\u17b6\u178e\u17b6\u1785\u1780\u17d2\u179a\u1780\u1798\u17d2\u1796\u17bb\u1787\u17b6, Preah Barum Reachea Veang Nei Preah Reacheanachak Kampuchea; French: Palais royal de Phnom Penh), in Chey Chumneas, Phnom Penh, Cambodia, is a complex of buildings which serves as the royal residence of the king of Cambodia. Its full name in the Khmer language is Preah Barum Reachea Veang Chaktomuk Serei Mongkol (Khmer: \u1796\u17d2\u179a\u17c7\u1794\u179a\u1798\u179a\u17b6\u1787\u179c\u17b6\u17c6\u1784\u1785\u178f\u17bb\u1798\u17bb\u1781\u179f\u17b7\u179a\u17b8\u1798\u1784\u17d2\u1782\u179b). The Kings of Cambodia have occupied it since it was built in the 1860s, with a period of absence when the country came into turmoil during and after the reign of the Khmer Rouge.\nThe palace was constructed between 1866 and 1870, after King Norodom relocated the royal capital from Oudong to Phnom Penh. It was built atop an old citadel called Banteay Kev. It faces approximately East and is situated at the Western bank of the cross division of the Tonle Sap River and the Mekong River called Chaktomuk (an allusion to Brahma).\n\n\n== History ==\n\n \nThe establishment of the Royal Palace in Phnom Penh in 1866 is a comparatively recent event in the history of the Khmer and Cambodia. The seat of Khmer power in the region rested in or near Angkor north of the Great Tonle Sap Lake from 802 AD until the early 15th century. After the Khmer court moved from Angkor in the 15th century after destroyed by Siam, it first settled in Phnom Penh which back then named as Krong Chatomok Serei Mongkol (Khmer: \u1780\u17d2\u179a\u17bb\u1784\u1785\u178f\u17bb\u1798\u17bb\u1781\u179f\u17b7\u179a\u17b8\u1798\u1784\u17d2\u1782\u179b) in 1434 (or 1446) and stayed for some decades, but by 1494 had moved on to Basan, and later Longvek and then Oudong. The capital did not return to Phnom Penh until the 19th century and there is no record or remnants of any Royal Palace in Phnom Penh prior to the 19th century. In 1813, King Ang Chan (1796\u20131834) constructed Banteay Kev (the 'Crystal Citadel') on the site of the current Royal Palace and stayed there very briefly before moving to Oudong. Banteay Kev was burned in 1834 when the retreating Siamese army razed Phnom Penh. It was not until after the implementation of the French Protectorate in Cambodia in 1863 that the capital was moved from Oudong to Phnom Penh, and the current Royal Palace was founded and constructed.\n\nAt the time that King Norodom (1860\u20131904) the eldest son of King Ang Duong, who ruled on behalf of Siam, signed the Treaty of Protection with France in 1863, the capital of Cambodia resided at Oudong, about 45 kilometres northeast of Phnom Penh. Earlier in 1863 a temporary wooden Palace was constructed a bit north of the current Palace site in Phnom Penh. The first Royal Palace to be built at the present location was designed by architect Neak Okhna Tepnimith Mak and constructed by the French Protectorate in 1866. On the year of 1865, year of the cow, at nine o'clock in the morning, King Norodom moved the Royal court from Oudong to the new Royal Palace in Phnom Penh and the city became the official capital of Cambodia the following year. Over the next decade several buildings and houses were added, many of which have since been demolished and replaced, including an early Chanchhaya Pavilion and Throne Hall (1870). The Royal court was installed permanently at the new Royal Palace in 1871 and the walls surrounding the grounds were raised in 1873. Many of the buildings of the Royal Palace, particularly of this period, were constructed using a combination of traditional Khmer architectural but also incorporating significant European features and design as well. One of the most unusual surviving structures from this period is the iron-sided Napoleon Pavilion which was a gift from France in 1876. It is currently closed to the public for renovations because of its poor state of conservation.\nKing Sisowath (1904\u20131927) made several major contributions to the current Royal Palace, adding the Phochani Hall in 1907 (inaugurated in 1912), and from 1913-1919 demolishing several old buildings, and replacing and expanding the old Chanchhaya Pavilion and the Throne Hall with the current structures. These buildings employ traditional Khmer artistic style and Angkorian inspired design, particularly in the Throne Hall, though some European elements remain. The next major construction came in the 1930s under King Monivong with the addition of the Royal Chapel, Vihear Suor (1930), and the demolition and replacement of the old Royal residence with the Khemarin Palace (1931), which serves as the official Royal residence to this day. From the reign of King Sihanouk, other significant additions are the 1956 addition of the Villa Kantha Bopha to accommodate foreign guests, and the 1953 construction of the Damnak Chan originally installed to house the High Council of the Throne.\n\n\n== Buildings of the Royal Palace ==\nThe complex is divided by walls into four main compounds. On the south side is the Silver Pagoda, to the north side is the Khemarin Palace and the central compound contains the Throne Hall and to the west is the private sector or the Inner Court. The buildings of the palace were built gradually over time, and some were dismantled and rebuilt as late as the 1960s. Some older buildings date back to the 19th century.\n\n\n== Architecture and Area ==\nThe Royal Palace of Cambodia is a fine example of Khmer architecture with a slight French touch featuring its layout of the defensive wall (kampaeng), throne hall (preah tineang), Temple of the Emerald Buddha (Wat Preah Keo Morakot), stupas (chedei), towering spires (prang prasat) and mural paintings. The Royal Palace of Phnom Penh covers an area of 174,870 square metres (1,882,300 sq ft) (402m x 435m).\n\n\n=== Throne Hall ===\n\nThe Preah Tineang Tevea Vinnichay Mohai Moha Prasat or \"Throne Hall\" (Khmer: \u1796\u17d2\u179a\u17c7\u1791\u17b8\u1793\u17b6\u17c6\u1784\u1791\u17c1\u179c\u17b6\u179c\u17b7\u1793\u17b7\u1785\u17d2\u1786\u17d0\u1799\u1798\u17a0\u17d0\u1799\u1798\u17a0\u17b6\u1794\u17d2\u179a\u17b6\u179f\u17b6\u1791) means the \"Sacred Seat of Judgement.\"\n\nThe Throne Hall is where the king's confidants, generals and royal officials once carried out their duties. It is still in use today as a place for religious and royal ceremonies (such as coronations and royal weddings) as well as a meeting place for guests of the King. The cross-shaped building is crowned with three spires. The central, 59-metre spire is topped with the white, four-faced head of Brahma. Inside the Throne Hall contains three royal thrones (one is more of western style and the other two are traditional) and golden busts of Cambodians kings and queens starting from the reign of King Ang Doung onwards. This Throne Hall is the second to be built on this site. The first was constructed in 1869-1870 under King Norodom. That Throne Hall was demolished in 1915. The present building was constructed in 1917 and inaugurated by King Sisowath in 1919. The building is 30x60 metres. As with all buildings and structure at the Palace, the Throne Hall faces east and is best photographed in the morning. When visiting note the thrones (Reach Balaing in front and Preah Thineang Bossabok higher at the back) and the beautiful ceiling frescoes of the Reamker. To the north of the thrones stands the statue of His Majesty Sisowath Monivong standing holding the Royal Sword. The statue is made with gold and shows him dressed in casual clothes. While to the south of the thrones stands the gold statue of His Majesty King Sisowath sitting on the Preah Thineang Bossabok dressed and covered with the Royal Regalia of Cambodia (as you can see he is wearing the Crown, the Sopourna Bat or the royal footwear and in his right hand holds the Royal Sword. He sits on the Preah Thineang Bossabok which is made to look like the real one to the right.\nThe traditional throne or The Preah Tineang Bossabok (Khmer: \u1796\u17d2\u179a\u17c7\u1791\u17b8\u1793\u17b6\u17c6\u1784\u1794\u17bb\u179f\u17d2\u1794\u17bb\u1780) is an ancient nine-level classical Khmer-style throne. Each Khmer King has to be seated on it on the coronation day while wearing the Royal Regalia. It is covered with intricate floral carvings and has two levels of small statues of Garudas lifting the upper part of the bossabok. Three of the nine levels of the throne represent the levels of hell, middle earth and the heavens. Surrounding the bossabok are the four gold nine-tiered umbrellas, these are called the Aphirom (Khmer: \u17a2\u1797\u17b7\u179a\u1798\u17d2\u1799). Finally, the bossabok is topped by the white Royal Nine-tiered umbrella (Khmer: \u1796\u17d2\u179a\u17c7\u1798\u17a0\u17b6\u179f\u17d2\u179c\u17c1\u178f\u1786\u17d0\u178f\u17d2\u179a) that signifies the universal power the king has. In front of the bossabok is the throne. The table that stands next to the Royal Throne holds on it a golden tea set and the golden set of betel and areca nuts container set, which are part of the regalia and are always on the table, or otherwise called the Pean Preah Srei (Khmer: \u1796\u17b6\u1793\u1796\u17d2\u179a\u17c7\u179f\u17d2\u179a\u17b8). Behind the preah thineang bossabok is another bossabok called the Preah Tineang Nearyrath Sophea (Khmer: \u1796\u17d2\u179a\u17c7\u1791\u17b8\u1793\u17b6\u17c6\u1784\u1793\u17b6\u179a\u17b8\u179a\u17d0\u178f\u17d2\u1793\u179f\u17c4\u1797\u17b6), the Preah Thineang Bossabok is for the king and the Preah Thineang Nearyrath Sophea at the back is for the queen. Like every king has to sit on the front bossabok, every queen also needs to sit on the taller bossabok behind. After sitting on the bossaboks while wearing the regalia, the kings and queens will be escorted to their palanquins to be paraded around the city.\n\n\n=== Moonlight Pavilion ===\n\nThe Preah Thineang Chan Chhaya (Khmer: \u1796\u17d2\u179a\u17c7\u1791\u17b8\u1793\u17d0\u1784\u1785\u17d0\u1793\u17d2\u1791\u1786\u17b6\u1799\u17b6) or \"Moonlight Pavilion\", is an open-air pavilion that serves as stage for Khmer classical dance in the past and present. It is one of the most notable buildings of the palace as it easily seen from the outside as it was built alongside a section of the palace walls. The Chan Chhaya Pavilion has a balcony that was used as a platform for viewing parades marching along Sothearos Boulevard of Phnom Penh. The current Pavilion is the second incarnation of the Chanchhaya Pavilion, this one constructed in 1913\u201314 under King Sisowath to replace the earlier wooden pavilion built under King Norodom. The current pavilion is of a similar design as the earlier version. The Chanchhaya Pavilion dominates the facade of the Palace on Sothearos Blvd. The Pavilion serves as a venue for the Royal Dancers, as a tribune for the King to address the crowds and as a place to hold state and Royal banquets. Most recently, the Pavilion was used for a banquet and a tribune for the new King at the 2004 coronation of King Norodom Sihamoni.\n\n\n=== Silver Pagoda ===\n\nThe Silver Pagoda is a compound located on the South side of the palace complex. It features a royal temple officially called Preah Vihear Preah Keo Morakot (Khmer: \u1796\u17d2\u179a\u17c7\u179c\u17b7\u17a0\u17b6\u179a\u1796\u17d2\u179a\u17c7\u1780\u17c2\u179c\u1798\u179a\u1780\u178f) but is commonly referred to as Wat Preah Keo (Khmer: \u179c\u178f\u17d2\u178f\u1796\u17d2\u179a\u17c7\u1780\u17c2\u179c). Its main building houses many national treasures such as gold and jeweled Buddha statues. Most notable is a small crystal Buddha (the \"Emerald Buddha\" of Cambodia) \u2013 undetermined whether made of Baccarat Crystal in 19th century or of other kind of crystal in 17th century \u2013 and a near-life-size, Maitreya Buddha encrusted with 9,584 diamonds dressed in royal regalia commissioned by King Sisowath. During King Sihanouk's pre-Khmer Rouge reign, the Silver Pagoda was inlaid with more than 5,000 silver tiles and some of its outer facade was remodelled with Italian marble.\nThere are also other structures surrounding the main building or the vihear. To the east is the statue of King Norodom sits on a white horse. To the north of the vihear is the library.  At the northwestern corner is the bell tower and south of that is the model of Angkor Wat. South of the vihear stand four structures: from west to east the Chedi (stupa) of H.M. King Suramarit and Queen Kossamak, the Dharmasala, the Chedi of Princess Kantha Bupha and The Phnom Mondop (mount mondop) where the statue of Preah Ko is situated. The wall that surrounds the structures is covered with the painting of the epic story of Reamker but because neglected care, the bottom half of the painting faded throughout the years.\n\n\n=== Khemarin Palace ===\nThe Khemarin Palace is the common English name for a building called Khemarin Moha Prasat (Khmer: \u1781\u17c1\u1798\u179a\u17b7\u1793\u17d2\u179a\u17d2\u178f\u1798\u17a0\u17b6\u1794\u17d2\u179a\u17b6\u179f\u17b6\u1791) [Prasat (temple or palace) Khmer + Indra] or in Khmer meaning the \"Palace of the Khmer King.\" It is used as an official residence of the King of Cambodia. This compound is separated from other buildings by a small wall and is located to the right of the Throne Hall. The main building is topped with a single spired prang.\n\n\n=== Other structures ===\nOther structures include, Hor Samran Phirun, Hor Samrith Phimean, Damnak Chan, Phochani Pavilion (dance hall), Serey Monkol Pavilion (royal conference hall), King Jayavarman VII Pavilion, Vihear Suor (royal chapel), Villa Kantha Bopha, Villa Chumpou, Villa Sahametrei, and some less significant buildings in an area closed to the public.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n=== Gardens ===\n\nThe palace has various gardens with tropical flowers and plants, such as Allamanda cathartica, Couroupita guianensis and Jatropha integerrima.\n\n\n== The Royal Palace today ==\nThe Royal Palace has had some major modifications to its buildings over time; nearly all of the King Norodom era buildings have been demolished completely. The King's living area (closed to public) has also undergone big changes. In the 1960s at Queen Kossamak's command the Silver Pagoda was rebuilt due to the original aging structure being too weak to stand.\nThe palace has always been a popular tourist attraction in Phnom Penh. Visitors are able to wander around the Silver Pagoda compound and the central compound containing the Throne Hall and Chan Chhaya Pavilion.  The King's living area, which actually takes up half of the total palace ground area, including Khemarin Palace, Villa Kantha Bopha, Serey Mongkol Pavilion, royal gardens, and a number of other buildings and pavilions, is closed to the public.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n=== Citations ===\n\n\n=== Bibliography ===\n\n\n== External links ==\n Media related to Royal Palace, Phnom Penh at Wikimedia Commons\n\nNational Radio | The Royal Palace\nCambodian Ministry of Tourism | Royal Palace of Phnom Penh\nLeisure Cambodia | Article about the riverfront shrine\n6 Photos with descriptions - The Royal Palace, Phnom Penh\n84 High quality digital photos of the palace taken by an amateur photographer",

        "wiki": "The Tuol Sleng Genocide Museum (Khmer: \u179f\u17b6\u179a\u1798\u1793\u17d2\u1791\u17b8\u179a\u17a7\u1780\u17d2\u179a\u17b7\u178a\u17d2\u178b\u1780\u1798\u17d2\u1798\u1794\u17d2\u179a\u179b\u17d0\u1799\u1796\u17bc\u1787\u179f\u17b6\u179f\u1793\u17cd\u1791\u17bd\u179b\u179f\u17d2\u179b\u17c2\u1784) is a museum in Phnom Penh, the capital of Cambodia, chronicling the Cambodian genocide. The site is a former secondary school which was used as Security Prison 21 (S-21) by the Khmer Rouge regime from its rise to power in 1975 to its fall in 1979. From 1976 to 1979, an estimated 20,000 people were imprisoned at Tuol Sleng (the real number is unknown). Tuol Sleng (Khmer: \u1791\u17bd\u179b\u179f\u17d2\u179b\u17c2\u1784 Khmer pronunciation: [tu\u0259l slae\u014b]) means \"Hill of the Poisonous Trees\" or \"Strychnine Hill\". Tuol Sleng was just one of at least 150 torture and execution centers established by the Khmer Rouge, though other sources put the figure at 196 prison centers. On July 26, 2010, the Extraordinary Chambers in the Courts of Cambodia convicted the chief of Tuol Sleng Prison, Kang Kek Iew, (alias Duch) for crimes against humanity and grave breaches of the 1949 Geneva Conventions and sentenced him to life imprisonment.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nFormerly the Tuol Svay Pray High School, named after a royal ancestor of King Norodom Sihanouk, the five buildings of the complex were converted in March/April 1976 into a prison and interrogation center. Before other buildings in town were used already as prison S-21. The Khmer Rouge renamed the complex \"Security Prison 21\" (S-21) and construction began to adapt the prison to the inmates: the buildings were enclosed in electrified barbed wire, the classrooms converted into tiny prison and torture chambers, and all windows were covered with iron bars and barbed wire to prevent escapes and suicides.\nFrom 1976 to 1979, an estimated 20,000 people were imprisoned at Tuol Sleng (the real number is unknown). At any one time, the prison held between 1,000\u20131,500 prisoners. They were repeatedly tortured and coerced into naming family members and close associates, who were in turn arrested, tortured and killed. In the early months of S-21's existence, most of the victims were from the previous Lon Nol regime and included soldiers, government officials, as well as academics, doctors, teachers, students, factory workers, monks, engineers, etc. Later, the party leadership's paranoia turned on its own ranks and purges throughout the country saw thousands of party activists and their families brought to Tuol Sleng and murdered. Those arrested included some of the highest ranking communist politicians such as Khoy Thoun, Vorn Vet and Hu Nim. Although the official reason for their arrest was \"espionage\", these men may have been viewed by Khmer Rouge leader Pol Pot as potential leaders of a coup against him. Prisoners' families were sometimes brought en masse to be interrogated and later executed at the Choeung Ek extermination center.\nIn 1979, the prison was uncovered by the invading Vietnamese army. In 1979/80, the prison was reopened by the government of the People's Republic of Kampuchea as a historical museum memorializing the actions of the Khmer Rouge regime.\n\n\n=== Life in the prison ===\nUpon arrival at the prison, prisoners were photographed and required to give detailed autobiographies, beginning with their childhood and ending with their arrest. After that, they were forced to strip to their underwear, and their possessions were confiscated. The prisoners were then taken to their cells. Those taken to the smaller cells were shackled to the walls or the concrete floor. Those who were held in the large mass cells were collectively shackled to long pieces of iron bar.  The shackles were fixed to alternating bars; the prisoners slept with their heads in opposite directions. They slept on the floor without mats, mosquito nets, or blankets. They were forbidden to talk to each other.The day in the prison began at 4:30 a.m. when prisoners were ordered to strip for inspection. The guards checked to see if the shackles were loose or if the prisoners had hidden objects they could use to commit suicide. Over the years, several prisoners managed to kill themselves, so the guards were very careful in checking the shackles and cells. The prisoners received four small spoonfuls of rice porridge and watery soup of leaves twice a day. Drinking water without asking the guards for permission resulted in serious beatings. The inmates were hosed down every four days.The prison had very strict regulations, and severe beatings were inflicted upon any prisoner who tried to disobey. Almost every action had to be approved by one of the prison's guards. The prisoners were sometimes forced to eat human feces and drink human urine. The unhygienic living conditions in the prison caused skin diseases, lice, rashes, ringworm and other ailments. The prison's medical staff were untrained and offered treatment only to sustain prisoners' lives after they had been injured during interrogation. When prisoners were taken from one place to another for interrogation, they were blindfolded. Guards and prisoners were not allowed to converse. Moreover, within the prison, people who were in different groups were not allowed to have contact with one another.\n\n\n=== Torture and extermination ===\n\nMost prisoners at S-21 were held there for two to three months. However, several high-ranking Khmer Rouge cadres were held longer. Within two or three days after they were brought to S-21, all prisoners were taken for interrogation. The torture system at Tuol Sleng was designed to make prisoners confess to whatever crimes they were charged with by their captors. Prisoners were routinely beaten and tortured with electric shocks, searing hot metal instruments and hanging, as well as through the use of various other devices. Some prisoners were cut with knives or suffocated with plastic bags. Other methods for generating confessions included pulling out fingernails while pouring alcohol on the wounds, holding prisoners' heads under water, and the use of the waterboarding technique. Women were sometimes raped by the interrogators, even though sexual abuse was against Democratic Kampuchea (DK) policy. The perpetrators who were found out were executed. Although many prisoners died from this kind of abuse, killing them outright was discouraged, since the Khmer Rouge needed their confessions. The \"Medical Unit\" at Tuol Sleng, however, did kill at least 100 prisoners by bleeding them to death. It is proven that medical experiments were performed on certain prisoners. There is clear evidence that patients in Cambodia were sliced open and had organs removed with no anesthetic. The camp's director, Kang Kek Iew, has acknowledged that \"live prisoners were used for surgical study and training. Draining blood was also done.\"In their confessions, the prisoners were asked to describe their personal background. If they were party members, they had to say when they joined the revolution and describe their work assignments in DK. Then the prisoners would relate their supposed treasonous activities in chronological order. The third section of the confession text described prisoners' thwarted conspiracies and supposed treasonous conversations. At the end, the confessions would list a string of traitors who were the prisoners' friends, colleagues, or acquaintances. Some lists contained over a hundred names. People whose names were in the confession list were often called in for interrogation.Typical confessions ran into thousands of words in which the prisoner would interweave true events in their lives with imaginary accounts of their espionage activities for the CIA, the KGB, or Vietnam. Physical torture was combined with sleep deprivation and deliberate neglect of the prisoners. The torture implements are on display in the museum. It is believed that the vast majority of prisoners were innocent of the charges against them and that the torture produced false confessions. Not all prisoners were tortured.\nFor the first year of S-21's existence, corpses were buried near the prison. However, by the end of 1976, cadres ran out of burial spaces, the prisoner and family members were taken to the Boeung Choeung Ek (\"Crow's Feet Pond\") extermination centre, fifteen kilometers from Phnom Penh. There, they were killed by a group of teenagers led by a Comrade Teng being battered with iron bars, pickaxes, machetes and many other makeshift weapons owing to the scarcity and cost of ammunition. After the prisoners were executed, the soldiers who had accompanied them from S-21 buried them in graves that held as few as 6 and as many as 100 bodies.\n\n\n=== Non-Cambodian prisoners ===\nEven though the vast majority of the victims were Cambodian, some were foreigners, including 488 Vietnamese, 31 Thai, one Laotian, one Arab, one Briton, four French, two Americans, one Canadian, one New Zealander, two Australians, one Indonesian. Khmers of Indian and Pakistani descent were also imprisoned.\nAlmost all non-Cambodians had left the country by early May 1975, following an overland evacuation of the French Embassy in trucks. The few who remained were seen as a security risk. Though most of the foreign victims were either Vietnamese or Thai, a number of Western prisoners, many picked up at sea by Khmer Rouge patrol boats, also passed through S-21 between April 1976 and December 1978. No foreign prisoners survived captivity in S-21.\nTwo Franco-Vietnamese brothers named Rovin and Harad Bernard were detained in April 1976 after they were transferred from Siem Reap where they had worked tending cattle. Another Frenchman named Andre Gaston Courtigne, a 30-year-old clerk and typist at the French embassy, was arrested the same month along with his Khmer wife in Siem Reap.It is possible that a handful of French nationals who went missing after the 1975 evacuation of Phnom Penh also passed through S-21. \nTwo Americans were captured under similar circumstances. James Clark and Lance McNamara in April 1978 were sailing when their boat drifted off course and sailed into Cambodian waters. They were arrested by Khmer patrol boats, taken ashore, where they were blindfolded, placed on trucks, and taken to the then-deserted Phnom Penh.\nTwenty-six-year-old John D. Dewhirst, a British tourist, was one of the youngest foreigners to die in the prison. He was sailing with his New Zealand companion, Kerry Hamill, and their Canadian friend Stuart Glass when their boat drifted into Cambodian territory and was intercepted by Khmer patrol boats on August 13, 1978. Glass was killed during the arrest, while Dewhirst and Hamill were captured, blindfolded, and taken to shore. Both were executed after having been tortured for several months at Tuol Sleng. Witnesses reported that a foreigner was burned alive; initially, it was suggested that this might have been John Dewhirst, but a survivor would later identify Kerry Hamill as the victim of this particular act of brutality. Robert Hamill, his brother, and a champion Atlantic rower, would years later make a documentary, Brother Number One, about his brother's incarceration. One of the last foreign prisoners to die was twenty-nine-year-old American Michael S. Deeds, who was captured with his friend Christopher E. DeLance on November 24, 1978 while sailing from Singapore to Hawaii. His confession was signed a week before the Vietnamese army invaded Cambodia and ousted the Khmer Rouge. In 1989, Deeds' brother, Karl Deeds, traveled to Cambodia in attempts to find his brother's remains, but was unsuccessful. On September 3, 2012, DeLance's photograph was identified among the caches of inmate portraits.As of 1999, there were a total of 79 foreign victims on record, but former Tuol Sleng Khmer Rouge photographer Nim Im claims that the records are not complete. On top of that, there is also an eyewitness account of a Cuban and a Swiss who passed through the prison, though no official records of either are shown.\n\n\n=== Survivors of Tuol Sleng ===\nOut of an estimated 20,000 people imprisoned at Tuol Sleng, there were only twelve known survivors: seven adults and five children. One child died shortly after the liberation. As of mid-September 2011, only three of the adults and four children are thought to be still alive: Chum Mey, Bou Meng, and Chim Meth. All three said they were kept alive because they had skills their captors judged to be useful.  Bou Meng, whose wife was killed in the prison, is an artist. Chum Mey was kept alive because of his skills in repairing machinery. Chim Meth was held in S-21 for 2 weeks and transferred to the nearby Prey Sar prison. She may have been spared because she was from Stoeung district in Kampong Thom where Comrade Duch was born. She intentionally distinguished herself by emphasising her provincial accent during her interrogations. Vann Nath, who was spared because of his ability to paint, died on September 5, 2011. Norng Chan Phal, one of the surviving children has just published his story.The Documentation Center of Cambodia has recently estimated that, in fact, at least 179 prisoners were freed from S-21 between 1975 and 1979 and approximately 23 prisoners (including 5 children, two of them siblings Norng Chanphal and Norng Chanly) survived when the prison was liberated in January 1979. One child died short after. Of the 179 prisoners who were released most disappeared and only a few are known to have survived after 1979. Further research needs to be done. It was found that at least 60 persons (out of the DC Cam list) who are listed as having survived, were first released, but later rearrested and executed.\n\n\n=== Staff of S-21 ===\nThe prison had a staff of 1,720 people throughout the whole period. Of those, approximately 300 were office staff, internal workforce and interrogators. The other 1,400 were general workers, including people who grew food for the prison. Several of these workers were children taken from the prisoner families. The chief of the prison was Khang Khek Ieu (also known as Comrade Duch), a former mathematics teacher who worked closely with Khmer Rouge leader Pol Pot. Other leading figures of S-21 were Kim Vat aka Ho (deputy chief of S-21), Peng (chief of guards), Mam Nai aka Chan (chief of the Interrogation Unit), and Tang Sin Hean aka Pon (interrogator). Pon was the person who interrogated important people such as Keo Meas, Nay Sarann, Ho Nim, Tiv Ol, and Phok Chhay.The documentation unit was responsible for transcribing tape-recorded confessions, typing the handwritten notes from prisoners' confessions, preparing summaries of confessions, and maintaining files. In the photography sub-unit, workers took mug shots of prisoners when they arrived, pictures of prisoners who had died while in detention, and pictures of important prisoners after they were executed. Thousands of photographs have survived, but thousands are still missing.\nThe defense unit was the largest unit in S-21. The guards in this unit were mostly teenagers. Many guards found the unit's strict rules hard to obey. Guards were not allowed to talk to prisoners, to learn their names, or to beat them. They were also forbidden to observe or eavesdrop on interrogations, and they were expected to obey 30 regulations, which barred them from such things as taking naps, sitting down or leaning against a wall while on duty. They had to walk, guard, and examine everything carefully. Guards who made serious mistakes were arrested, interrogated, jailed and put to death. Most of the people employed at S-21 were terrified of making mistakes and feared being tortured and killed.The interrogation unit was split into three separate groups: Krom Noyobai or the political unit, Krom Kdao or the hot unit and Krom Angkiem, or the chewing unit. The hot unit (sometimes called the cruel unit) was allowed to use torture. In contrast, the cold unit (sometimes called the gentle unit) was prohibited from using torture to obtain confessions. If they could not make prisoners confess, they would transfer them to the hot unit. The chewing unit dealt with tough and important cases. Those who worked as interrogators were literate and usually in their 20s.Some of the staff who worked in Tuol Sleng also ended up as prisoners. They confessed to being lazy in preparing documents, to having damaged machines and various equipment, and to having beaten prisoners to death without permission when assisting with interrogations.\n\n\n=== Security regulations ===\n\nWhen prisoners were first brought to Tuol Sleng, they were made aware of ten rules that they were to follow during their incarceration. What follows is what is posted today at the Tuol Sleng Museum; the imperfect grammar is a result of faulty translation from the original Khmer:\n\n1. You must answer accordingly to my question.  Don't turn them away.\n2. Don't try to hide the facts by making pretexts this and that, you are strictly prohibited to contest me.\n3. Don't be a fool for you are a chap who dare to thwart the revolution.\n4. You must immediately answer my questions without wasting time to reflect.\n5. Don't tell me either about your immoralities or the essence of the revolution.\n6. While getting lashes or electrification you must not cry at all.\n7. Do nothing, sit still and wait for my orders. If there is no order, keep quiet. When I ask you to do something, you must do it right away without protesting.\n8. Don't make pretext about Kampuchea Krom in order to hide your secret or traitor.\n9. If you don't follow all the above rules, you shall get many lashes of electric wire.\n10. If you disobey any point of my regulations you shall get either ten lashes or five shocks of electric discharge.During testimony at the Khmer Rouge Tribunal on April 27, 2009, Duch claimed the 10 security regulations were a fabrication of the Vietnamese officials that first set up the Tuol Sleng Genocide Museum.\n\n\n=== Discovery of Tuol Sleng ===\nIn 1979, H\u1ed3 V\u0103n T\u00e2y, a Vietnamese combat photographer, was the first journalist to document Tuol Sleng to the world. H\u1ed3 and his colleagues followed the stench of rotting corpses to the gates of Tuol Sleng. The photos of H\u1ed3 documenting what he saw when he entered the site are exhibited in Tuol Sleng today.The Khmer Rouge required that the prison staff make a detailed dossier for each prisoner. Included in the documentation was a photograph. Since the original negatives and photographs were separated from the dossiers in the 1979\u20131980 period, most of the photographs remain anonymous today.\n\n\n== Description ==\n\nThe buildings at Tuol Sleng are preserved, some rooms as they were left when the Khmer Rouge were driven out in 1979. The regime kept extensive records, including thousands of photographs. Several rooms of the museum are now lined, floor to ceiling, with black and white photographs of some of the estimated 20,000 prisoners who passed through the prison.\nThe site has four main buildings, known as Building A, B, C, and D. Building A holds the large cells in which the bodies of the last victims were discovered. Building B holds galleries of photographs. Building C holds the rooms sub-divided into small cells for prisoners. Building D holds other memorabilia including instruments of torture.\nOther rooms contain only a rusting iron bedframe, beneath a black and white photograph showing the room as it was found by the Vietnamese. In each photograph, the mutilated body of a prisoner is chained to the bed, killed by his fleeing captors only hours before the prison was captured. Other rooms preserve leg-irons and instruments of torture. They are accompanied by paintings by former inmate Vann Nath showing people being tortured, which were added by the post-Khmer Rouge regime installed by the Vietnamese in 1979.\nThe museum is open to the public from 8 am to 5 pm. Visitors have the opportunity of viewing a 'survivor testimony' from 2:30-3pm (Monday - Friday). Along with the Choeung Ek Memorial (The Killing Fields), the Tuol Sleng Genocide Museum is included as a point of interest for those visiting Cambodia. Tuol Sleng also remains an important educational site as well as memorial for Cambodians. Since 2010, the ECCC brings Cambodians on a 'study tour' to the Tuol Sleng, Choeung Ek and finishing at the ECCC complex. During 2010, around 27,000 Cambodians visited the museum through this tour. (See ECCC Court Report January 2011) Some believed that ghosts of the victims continue to haunt the place.A number of images from Tuol Sleng are featured in the 1992 Ron Fricke film Baraka.\n\n\n== Documentary ==\n\nS-21: The Khmer Rouge Killing Machine is a 2003 film by Rithy Panh, a Cambodian-born, French-trained filmmaker who lost his family when he was 11. The film features two Tuol Sleng survivors, Vann Nath and Chum Mey, confronting their former Khmer Rouge captors, including guards, interrogators, a doctor and a photographer. The focus of the film is the difference between the feelings of the survivors, who want to understand what happened at Tuol Sleng to warn future generations, and the former jailers, who cannot escape the horror of the genocide they helped create.\n\n\n== See also ==\nEnemies of the People (film)\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Further reading ==\nVann Nath: A Cambodian Prison Portrait.

          "It's definitely worth a visit and the audio guide is greatly recommended. I think I spend roughly two hours listening to most of the stuff  and going on a leisurely pace. You could probably spend 1-2 hours more reading everything on the \u2026",

          "Important place to visit. Audio guide is fantastic. I listened to almost every single track (all except 3 of the \u201clisten anytime bonus tracks\u201d) and was still done in under 2 hours. Plan for a little more time if you need rest and reflection in between stops.",
          "Remember to dress modestly to visit this place (and other respectful places such as temples): long pants/skirt that pass knee length, do not show shoulders, back or belly.  Lily- our Cambodian tour organizer- thanked us for visiting here on \u2026",
          "As difficult as the story is, it is very well presented and shows a wealth of evidence and a tragic story. Focus is, rightfully, on human suffering and it rather makes one think. In this respect it is similar to Topography of Terror \u2026",
          "It was very fun but the locals where unhappy with me smiling and taking selfies otherwise its fun for the whole family",
          "This is definitely a piece of history that everyone should remember! This place showcases some many acts in Cambodia. This museum has an amazing and terrifying story, was transformed from high school to torturing chamber and then a genocide museum. I recommend it even if it can affect emotionally!",
          "Reality hits you when you listen to the audio guide, sometimes I was able to listen to a tour guide who had more dept into what happened there! Really impressive! the chambers where there is still blood on the ceiling from tortured people! \u2026",
          "Extremely sad and tragic place, but essential to visit. It\u2019s been a memorial almost continuously since liberation from the Khmer Rouge so you can see exactly what the site was like, including original \u201cfurnishings\u201d and even blood, in the \u2026",
          "A real eye opener to the history of Cambodia. Not an easy place to visit/hear about what happened but the audio guide was good and enabled you to move around at your own pace. Lots of shady spots to sit, take it all in and reflect. \nWorth a visit, remember to dress modestly!",
          "If you visit Cambodia, do not miss the killing fields or the Museum of Genocide. These places are the best way to understand what the country has gone through and to better respect its history. However, you must be prepared to be \u2026",

          "Probably the best place to go if you want to learn more about modern Khmer history. The audio guide for me is essential although some times can be harsh. This place is full of history  for the Cambodian people. Entrance tickets are $5 and audio guide $3 extra (only cash accepted)",
          "The reign of the Khmer Rouge left a deep wound in Cambodia's history and the country is still working to heal. Visiting the museum, educating yourself on Cambodia's past, and honoring the victims and their families who were affected by the \u2026",
          "Another very good museum with an excellent audio tour. The audio guide really brings you into the story & makes you shake your head is disbelief. A certain eye opener to the harsh conditions & torture that was witnesses here. You can even speak to some survivors at the end of the tour to explore more stories of those sad times.",
          "Not an easy experience. The audio guides are very well made, and allow you to move through the space at your own pace and provide ample space to reflect and listen to the stories of survivors and the tribunals. Some might also appreciate that they give content warnings for the more graphical images such as photos of dead bodies.",
          "Bone chilling experience of the horrors mearly 40 years ago. We bought tickets that included audio guides and spend 3.5 hours listening to all the stories. The narrator's English is excellent. Well worth the $8. Highly recommended.",
          "Very important museum and well presented.  You can see the tiny cells in which prisoners were held and read the stories of the people held here.  It's a difficult, but important stop.  You also have an opportunity to meet survivors and purchase their memoirs.",
          "Sad History of this country. This is the proper way of dealing with it. The Audio guiding ist a must. The Audio guide leads you over the campus of this former school. Pictures, cells,paintings ,tools on the original place where it happen. \u2026",
          "We were part of a tour group and our guide, Nin, was excellent. He shared his family\u2019s experience during the genocide. The museum is in a school that was converted to a prison during the war.  It does have some interesting points but it \u2026",

          "Stories of atrocities pepertrated by human to their fellow countryman. very tragic events.",
          "Going to this museum is not a fun activity but it is vital to visit it when in town. It shows the gruesome recent past of Cambodia that I personally wasn't aware of even having attended extended history classes in college. After learning about the history you can understand the country better and appreciate it more.",
          "Tuol Sleng is an indispensable place to visit when visiting Phnom Penh, a real eye opener into the history of Cambodia. I recommend to get the audioguide, it gives a very a good tour of the different buildings and detailed explanations of \u2026",

          "I highly recommend going here. It's very emotional and educational. Before going here I had no idea this happened.",
          "The audio tour is a must. Having it provides more context to your visit. Try allotting 3 hours for it so you get to pause and digest what has happened. This museum is a great memorial for Cambodia's painful history. I am glad that they have this so as not to forget the atrocities that happened during the time of the Khmer Rouge.",
          "I guess this place doesn't need ratings, it's a place where you just pay respects and learn about one of the country's darkest times. If you're the type of person who's just looking for fun then this place is not for you. Looking at the \u2026",
          "It was quite an experience. The tour is really well organized. I used the audio headset, and the way they explain it to you, seems like you're stepping back into time. I don't recommend it to the young as it's very eerie and there are \u2026",
          "I give this place a 3 star simply because it\u2019s very educational. It\u2019s a trip for history lesson. It\u2019s a \u2018visit it once only\u2019 kind of place. I originally didn\u2019t want to go but was part of a group tour so already got the tickets. When we \u2026",

          "It\u2019s a must go if you would like to learn more about the history of Cambodia. This place might not be suitable for children due to the graphical images. I did it without the audio but I would recommend you guys to use the Audio as it gives \u2026",
          "Really interesting place to visit. The layout audio guide is really good and gives you plenty of details to really understand the horrific and ugly things that happened here. I did not manage to visit the killing Fields which so many say \u2026",
          "A must for anyone coming to Phnom Penh. One of the most shocking visits I ever did, however the entire tour is fantastically designed, not falling for the easy calls for revenge or propaganda, or showing morbid details. Definitely a place where you want to get an audioguide, you'll not regret it. Give it 2 hours at least.",
          "Very interesting and emotional experience. Entrance fee is $8 with the audio guide, I would recommend taking it as it is very insightful and allows you to understand what you see in the different rooms.

          "If you are in Phnom Penh go there. It's very interesting and the area is well prepared. Take an audio guide for the full experience. One of the \"best\" things to do in Phnom Penh.",
          "The museum is a remarkable exploration of the recent history in Cambodia which reverberates throughout the Kmer culture to this day. Shows how the Kmer Rouge regime truly contends with Stalin and Mao for the most disastrous application of countrywide communism. Free audio tour guide \ud83d\udc4c",
          "A tragic location, however it is well presented with lots of information, but only if you so the audio tour. If you don't, you will not get very much information at all.

          "Its ina commercial place, you get a audio guide as part of the ticket(thankfully) as not much to read except the audio guide numbers in most places. It describes the hell people have gone through. If you are very optional or light hearted \u2026",
          "The well-equipped museum, reveals a lot of information about a horrible tragedy. Very satisfied with the quality of the guide. It is worth visiting so we can learn what mistakes no longer need to be repeated, the staff is very friendly, for me it was very educational! Recommend!",
          "Highly recommend visiting here for a thorough and disturbing look at the Cambodian genocide. The audio guide is hauntingly informative and you will leave with a true sense of the horror that took place there",
          "It is one of the saddest places I have seen. I wouldn't believe the horrors if not for pictures and displays. I hope they never forget what happened here.",
          "A fantastic experience but extremely sad. I'm glad that I now know how hard the Cambodians have had it. The history is very recent and effects today's cambodian politics",

          "Well organised to convey the tragic things that happened here. The audio device is equipped with detailed narration of the history of this place. Audio narration is available in multiple languages. \nThe area is preserved well and you will \u2026",
          "This is a must see for any visitor to Cambodia. The reality of what the Khmer Rouge destroyed becomes real and vivid. This place is not for children. I spent about three hours here and was drained by the time I left. This place is a \u2026",
          "Unbelievable what humanity is capable of. A must visit to learn something about the past of cambodia",
          "Mostly left as it was when it was found. Shocking what happens here. Nice audio tour that helps explain prison 21. 100% worth a visit if you have a couple of hours free. It has a small part about the killing fields so if you don\u2019t have chance to do both just do prison 21",
          "I think this tour is really informative in terms of the atrocities that offered in Cambodia. It was somber and really heavy but I feel important to understand Cambodia's modern history and why it is less developed in many aspects in relation to a neighboring country.",
          "This place really does speak for itself.\n\nIt's a must to take the audio guide, otherwise you'll really miss the whole point of visiting.\n\nThe buildings remain unchanged, preserved since their Discovery.",
          "This is a MUST VISIT if you are ever in Phnom Penh. But please be aware that this is a heart wrenching tour or visit! Learning the history and the atrocities committed here is simply over whelming and they even display the photos of the \u2026",
          "I can't say \"I loved it\". The museum is well put together and does an excellent job of describing the horrible things that happened here, especially if you rent the audio guide. But the subject is horrendous, and I didn't come away feeling good.",
          "The history is fascinating and emotional. I think everyone should see it! They have done a wonderful job of maintaining the site as close to the original site as possible. For me was a really challenging experience.",
          "Very good presentation of cambodia's cruel history. A must when staying in Phnom Penh to learn about Cambodia's past. Audio guide is recommended.",
          "A must see if you are in Cambodia. The visit is very difficult both because of what you see and what you hear on the audioguide, but luckily the courtyard outside of the buildings - which used to see the horrors - today is a nice garden \u2026",
          "Wow. This place was hard. To see all the horror that happened there is quite something... and the survivors that come there everyday to talk to the visitors have my highest respect!!! I highly recommend going there-even if it seems hard, that's what Cambodian history is!",
          "Incredibly interesting and worth visiting while in Phnom Phen. Do be warned that there are graphic  images so if going with children you may want to review the rooms before letting them enter. The audio guide is very good",
          "If you go it is a solemn experience. Definitely is worth the visit to understand the history. The reason why it is 3 stars is because of the truthfulness of the information they give in the audio tour. It is very biased and also a government owned so it has a bit of bias from that aswell",
          "Rich in history palaces! The trip was great as could be when visiting and learning about such terrifying things that occurred. I am very grateful that I did not live in that period; you must visit these things to understand how lucky you are!",
          "Tuol Sleng also known as S21 was a school that was re-purposed as the centre of a network of detention facilities that covered Cambodia during the infamous reign of Pol Pot and the Khmer Rouge. It now serves as a museum to tell the the \u2026",
          "I did the audioguided tour. Highly recommend it as it gives you the best overview of what happened there. \n\nA lot of the museum is left as it was in 1979 which is quite eerie",
          "This place is not for faint-hearted. I literally have no words to explain what I experienced but Ill try my best. My heart ached with everything that I learned here and to be honest I was struggling to walk, my legs felt heavy as the audio \u2026",
          "It worth a visit. I recommend you to buy the audio guide. You can spend 2h easily if you want. It will be a sad but interesting visit.",
          "A disturbing look into dystopia. Should be acknowledge, but it is hard too take in the full horror. Now, in part,  a peaceful place for reflection.",
          "V.interesting place with a lot of history. They handle the topic really well; sensitive and with out shying away from the truth of the events of what happened there. \nThe audio tour is an \u201coptional extra\u201d for $3 on top of the $5 entry but \u2026",
          "Very powerful. Makes you appreciate how lucky you are in general. Museums like this keep you aware how easy poor or bad regimes can come to power. Awareness hopefully breeds prevention",
          "It tells you a lot about what happened to the people of Cambodia. And it's a great experience. And it is very sad.",
          "I am firmly in the camp that mans inhumanity to man should not be hidden but be put out there in our faces so that one day we might bloody learn. Therefore, and especially as this atrocity happened in my lifetime, there was no way I was not \u2026",
          "Museum in Phnom Penh. This place is a former high school turned into the infamous Security Prison 21 by the Khmer Rouge regime.\nThis museum is one of the few places in the capital that is worth visiting. Although a visit to it is not easy.",
          "Museum costs 5 USD to enter but it's worth getting the audio guide for an extra 3 USD. I would not come here in a big tour group as it gets busy in some areas because of this. Expect to spend around an hour or so here for most people. Don't do this and the killing field in the same day",
          "This is an important and emotional visit that should be on everyone's agenda for Cambodia. It is life changing. Don't plan on doing much after your visit, you will probably need a lot of time to process. \nThe museum has excellent audio guides in many languages. Use them.",
          "Incredible. I've never been to such and emotion-stirring place before. They have done a wonderful job of maintaining the site and keeping it as close to the original site as possible. Bring tissues. It's a really challenging experience. I'd reccomend the audio tour and a solo visit. It takes a little while to digest the exhibitions.",
          "Don not know how to do the rating for this place. It is a museum about Khmer Rouge brutality on common people. Well maintained. Must take the audio guide or else no information for understanding. The atmosphere is gloomy and sad. Felt sadness deep inside after visiting. Not suitable for underage persons.",
          "Good museam that doesnt try to politicise the exhibits. Just tells the story the way it happened.",
          "Courtyard in the middle was good vibes.\n\nOverall atmosphere is quite depress, even you didn\u2019t listen to audio guide. \n\nStaffs were very nice and honest, no cheat.\n\nGood place!",
          "Impressive museum that gives you a feeling of a very sad part of the Cambodian history. Definitely worthwhile to visit if you want to understand a bit of what is Cambodia.",
          "One of the best museums I've ever been to. Incredible audio guide (at least in German). Horrifying what totalitarian regimes do to their own people. Beware!",
          "A somber reflection of a very dark period in history. The exhibits were well laid out and the local guide was very informative throughout the experience.",
          "I reluctantly give this place a 5 star review, but my reason is that this place has such a horrible history that it\u2019s hard to remember it in a good light. This museum is so tactically informative to give visitors an actuary history of the \u2026",
          "One should definitely visit....eye opener and thought provoking ! Like they say history teaches you a lot about the people.",
          "Good place to learn about the cruel past history of Khmer rouge in Phnom Penh. Very educational, fruitful and the same time heart breaking.\nNot suitable for kids. \nAudio guide is available in many languages not just Khmer and English but also include Chinese, Japanese, Korean, Spanish, French, Vietnamese and etc.",
          "If you travel through Cambodia, make sure to stop here. It's an sad but important part of history and should not left out. \nMay all the victims rest peacefully.",
          "Another must when in Phenom Phen. It's hard to believe the human race can stoop so low!!! It is so good that the people have retained such a fundamental part of there history so that the rest of the world can actually see what happened here.",
          "Truly shocking museum. A real eye opener. Audio guide is a must. Don't forget about dress code.",
          "You just have to go here on your trip. I recommend getting the audiotour. The english is very good and informative. The museum is a difficult but captivating experience.",
          "This place is perfect for all who want to learn the history of the brutal Khmer Rouge regime. I was very pleased with the services offered; the driver is vigilant and drives safely. RECOMMEND! You must visit it, you will not regret it!",
          "I have no words for this. For me, was the hardest part of this trip. Is something all of us should know. The audioguide is perfect. Highly recommended but you must to be strong.",
          "Nothing you want to see, but everyone needs to see.\n\nWhat you see is shocking and therefore so important. It helps you understanding the country and people!\nTake the audio guide!!!",
          "Very insightful, allow plenty of time to go through. Very deep but very eye opening to learn about Cambodia's not so distant past",
          "Important piece of Cambodian history that everyone should know. Go for the audio tour because otherwise you will miss a lot. Place that makes you think...",
          "Very interesting place \nCame here on a tour and really was able to learn a lot. You can rent audio but we decided to do it on own own and read all of the different signs, and even still without the audio they give you so much information. \u2026",
          "This museum tells the story of the Khmer Rouge genocide which occurred between 1975 and 1979. It is a sombre place and some rooms were difficult to enter emotionally.  The audio guide is excellent and explains events very well.  If you are in Phnom Penh it is well worth a visit.",
          "Informative, eye-opening, absolutely heartbreaking. Must see for anyone in Cambodia, but prepare a tear or 50.",
          "VERY INFORMATIVE! Even though what you will find here are some very sad events, they are worth knowing, they provided us a bus with air conditioning and they show a very informative video between the two stops. This visit is a must!",
          "Great history in this dark place and a large amount of information provided in the audio guide. \n\nIf in the area and need to learn about the terrible things that happened under Pol Pots regime then please visit this historic centre.",
          "A profoundly touching experience. I would highly recommend using the audio guide as it provides important information to understand the exhibits. This museum is an essential visit for anyone seeking to understand Cambodia.",
          "Excellent collection and presentation of very important information. It will weigh heavily on your emotions which is natural. Take some time to process what you learn. We went to a great coffee place just down the street called Dimora after \u2026",
          "A place to visit if you are on Phnom Penh.\nHard and true story, but very interesting",
          "A MUST in Phnom Penh! There You will see the Khmer Rouge brutality. Meet also Mr Chum Mey, one of the seven survivors.",
          "Great spot if you like history but the exhibitions are not labeled very well, so you have to pay for the audio guide to have any sense of the locations. Site could also be more maintained.",
          "Genocide in history is something we all have to know. Just be ready for this. Get the audio description and prepare for a though visit.",
          "My gawd...so devastating to see, but important to understand and remember.  I didn't get the audio guide, but wish I had.  The layout isn't the best, and there needs to be more signage, but don't let that stop you.",
          "Very sad museum but well worth visiting. I'd recommend going here before the killing fields to do them \"in order\" and make sure you get the audio guide which is really well done. Be aware of the dress code for legs and shoulders to be covered.",
          "A glimpse of what happened during the Khmer Rouge can be seen here. There are local guides and audio headsets that give you further details about the genocide and the backstory of each sites. You can also meet two of the S-21 survivors who \u2026",

          "A very important place on cambodia history. Audio tour is a must. best museum i went in a while",
          "One of the best museums I've ever been to. I've never been so immersed in the history of a place before.",
          "Such an interesting museum. It makes you understand the history and the horror of the red Khmer era. \nYou can feel all the atrocities that have been done there.\nI strongly recommend you to took with audio-guide, otherwise the visit would not be as interesting.",
          "Quite a difficult thing to learn about but an important piece of history. The audio guide is very informative and gives you insight into how bad the conditions were here.\nThere's optional extra sections you can listen to or you can just do \u2026",
          "It's a sad place to visit, the audio guide is really helpful and clear, highly recommended.",
          "A very, very sad and graphic story of what went on here (if you choose audio which I recommend you do). But a great place of history and 100% worth a visit if you\u2019re able to while in Phnom Phen. I bought a book off Chum Mey afterwards for $10 who is a survivor telling his side of the story..",
          "A very sad place to visit. It will bring up a lot of horrible and sad memories in the history of mankind. How can the leaders of a country kill half of the population just to achieve their ideals of a utopia!",
          "Sad to know many stories about the war. Good visit for those who interested in history.",
          "Profoundly moving memorial museum and the audio tour is a must as the information given was excellent. As you'd expect, some of the displays are not suitable for children. There didn't seem to be accurate info on the doc. movies or where \u2026",
          "Their guide is wonderful and in the end I was emotionally touched. I went on a tour that combines the museum with the killing fields, and I was deeply impressed, I didn't know there was such a museum; it was definitely worth a visit to Cambodia!",
          "It should show more evidence of war.\nWe had a same museum in Vietnam.\nRest in peace !!",
          "Very educational and emotional experience. Get a guide or an audio guide to fully understand the tour. Dress code is strictly enforced. Legs and shoulders should be covered.",
          "Tragic history of a nation undeserving of this period of horror.   I've seen the pictures many times, but the experience was still moving and troubling in person.   A must see in Phnom Penh, but still disturbing at best.",
          "When visiting Cambodias capital, Phnom Penh, this is a must to do and see, it gives you the insight of what happened at S21 operated by the Khmer Rouge, between 1975 until 1979, a real eye opener and utterly heartbreaking, 100% a must for respecting the city and its people who were lost or survived.",
          "100% worth the visit - spent about 2 hours there and definitely worth getting the audio guide",
          "Take the audio tour! It is super educational and well produced. It can be hard to listen to at times, but the narrator gives a warning in advance of the more difficult sections.",
          "Very thought provoking. Bought the audio guide ticket which was well worth it. They have 2 movies showing - one at 9 and one at 4. We watched the morning one which was very interesting, showed survivors meeting ex guards. The audio guide \u2026",
          "A well made museum that shows the  ruthless violence of Pol Pot and the Khmer Rouge. Definitely worth a visit. \nYou get a lot value with the audio guide. \n\nDon't forget to also visit the killing fields, Choeung Ek.",
          "Beyond description, really worth the time, plan for 2-3 hours, definitely rent the audio guide and follow its narrative.",
          "Every tourist must see this, a lesson to be learnt on how the lovely people of Cambodia were let down by wider world, who did nothing to stop the genocide",
          "Hou have to use the right entrance. The others say its closed.",

          "It coast 5 USD for the entrance fees + 3 USD for audio guidance. I paid for entrance  fee only,  and I did research on google before. There's  Wi-Fi public also, so its cool.",
          "Very graphic and often disturbing, this museum is not for everybody. However, it tells the horrible story of the crimes performed on this site very well and brings them very close to every visitor. A lot of pictures, descriptions and \u2026",
          "Very heavy experience, the audio tour is well worth it. It offers stories from survivors and families that were involved. It\u2019s a must see.",
          "I have spent there more than 3 hours. Very good audio guide for 3 USD.",
          "Better go with long trousers and t-shirt because they will make you cover otherwise and sell you quite expensively the clothes to cover you with. It is worth getting audio guide, otherwise you will learn nothing from this museum, there is barely any information on display.",
          "It's very important to be aware history. It is hard to find the right words. Unbelievable that things like this can happen. Even more important that we never forget so that they can never happen again.",
          "Good place in Phnom Penh to know about the history of Khmer Rouge.",
          "A must-see when in Phnom Penh. It\u2019s a dreadful experience, but one that should definitely be taken. And remember to rent an audio set- it\u2019s recorded by one of the survivors of the S-21 prison, which adds whole other layer to the visit. \nTuol Sleng is probably not the best place for children, or if so - rather the older ones.",
          "A piece of history portrayed respectfully.\nAudio is a must - well spoken, and easy to follow. Creating a deserving atmosphere.\nI highly recommend one takes the time to visit this memorial and pay respect to these people who lost their lives through no fault of their own.",

          "As other people wrote before me, it's hard to rate a place with such cruel and shocking history. I think when you are in Phnom Penh, you should go and see it. Learn about the history, as it may never happen again. Get the audio guide and take a whole day (to visit and then to take your time and digest).",

          "Weird to rate it with 5 stars, because it's not a pleasant place, but it's not intended to be. The audio guide is great and at the end I was emotionally touched. People died here, where tortured and you can still see the traces of it \u2026",
          "Very sombre but informative experience highlighting the horror of the Pol Pot regime.",
          "A must see I'm Phnom Penh to learn about the sad history of Cambodia.\n\nDefinitely take an audio guide. \n\nPrepare yourself for lots of sad stories.\nYou can meet some of the survivors towards the end of the tour. They are selling books about their experiences.",

          "Very important historical site. I HIGHLY reccomend the audio tour it just gives every room so much more weight.",
          "Great, sad place. Definitely get the audio guide. If you are coming here on a tour that combines the museum with the killing fields, try to pick a tour that starts with the killing fields, as the time they allow in the museum is not enough if you want to explore everything. I stayed for 2.5 hours - but everyone is different.",

          "A grim place to be. But you'll understand more of the Cambodian history and the story of their people. Can be emotionally disturbing for some.",
          "Very sad but definitely must see in Phnom Penh. It\u2019s hard to imagine how cruel the Khmer Rouge regime was (though I\u2019m coming from a post communism country). We spent there 2hours. The entrance fee is not high at all so almost everyone can afford this.",
          "S21 is definitely worth checking out if you are in Phnom Penh. $8pp for the audio tour which is definitely the way to to do it. Gives you so much more information and is simple to use. \n\nA very dark experience but one that everyone should \u2026",

          "i could really felt the cold breeze(?) when enter the rooms really \ud83d\ude31 even it was sunny hot that day. it was a sad history tho",
          "An eye opening historical site, brilliant audio and an honour to meet some of those that survived.",
          "This is a truly shocking place but important to visit if you are interested in the Cambodian Genocide. The audio guide was fantastic. I would definitely recommend listing to the \u2018extras\u2019 on the audio guide. The site is well maintained and peaceful.",
          "A unique experience. Brings what happened right to the fore.",
          "Must visit when you come to Phnompenh. Good service with guide-audio machine in many languages",
          "It is very interesting museum to see what happend here little more than 40 years ago. I tried to capture few grayscale pictures for more horrifying experience.",
          "If you come to Cambodia you have to visit this place in order to understand more the history of the people and country you are visiting.",
          "Very well done memorial museum, lot of contents and detailed audio guide in lots of languages. Things that must be known but very hard to digest..",
          "An experience that really puts into perspective the depths of human cruelty and the resolve that's slowly building up a nation. Needs more time if you are more sensitive, and not recommended for those too squeamish about gore. The stories \u2026",
          "S21 is quite tough to take in, but very interesting and well put-together / educational.\nTip: Audio guide is a must, otherwise you won\u2019t understand what each of the buildings was used for and what tragic stories are behind them.",
          "Definitely somewhere you should visit if you're interested in Khmer Rouge history. We visited this on the same day as the killing fields and - whilst both are a must - there's actually more to see and learn here than the fields themselves. \u2026",
          "Its not a nice place to visit. But it is a necessary visit. Ensure you hire an audio guide as there is little information otherwise. Some of the rooms and photographs are quite horrific. But this is a very informative place. Dress respectfully. Speak quietly. Learn.",
          "A must, a shocking place to visit, but we should learn so never to forget. Give at least  2hrs as you will need time to rest and recover, you may meet survivors who are selling their books. Use the audio guide well worth the small charge.",
          "Not a place you'll easily forget. You have to visit tuol sleng when you are here but it's not a fun day out",
          "Interesting place, and the audio guide was very good. This is of course a scary place but at the same time the most interesting museum that I have seen in Cambodia during my first 2 weeks here. You should go here before you go to the killing fields, then you will know the background a lot better.",
          "My heart still aches at the mention of this museum. It's a very emotional visit. The cruelty performed here on the people and the audio note explaining it literally made me shiver with fear and pain! The hardest part was learning about the \u2026",
          "Very dramatic, but one of must see in Phnom Penh",
          "Incredibly interesting, an eye opener to the atrocities of what happened not so long ago. Highly recommend!",
          "Loved is the wrong word. Harrowing experience, man's inhumanity to man",
          "Harrowing.  Every person should go and see this museum.  I only managed the first and second block. I couldn't continue",
          "Well equipped museum about a horrible tragedy. Very pleased with the quality of the audioguide. Sad that you have to recommend places like this.",
          "Staff museum will give you podcast to listen place by place story. Its like sorrow when i enter to this place. You are not allowed for Laugh inside the building. Seriously they have terrifying story places. \ud83e\udd15\ud83e\udd15\ud83e\udd15",
          "A must see to truly understand the horrors of that time......where was the rest of the world.",
          "A harrowing experience but an important one if visiting Phnom Penh. You can get an audio guide, or as we did, take a tour guide who will accept donation at the end. I would thoroughly recommend the tour guide, it\u2019s a far more real \u2026",
          "Words can't describe how sad to see the real place and things that witness this dark history. A must no 1 place to visit in PP. The audio tour is really helped to understand the situation back then.",
          "one of the tourist landmarks while in phnom penh.\nrecomended",
          "We met one of only 2 survivors from the S21 prison there. Keep an open mind as this museum provides a factual display of how man can be so hurtful to their fellow man. It is confronting at times but a slice of the country's history that \u2026",
          "S-21 is a must-see!! If we don't learn from history, we're doomed to repeat it. \nS-21 gave me a real (???) feeling of what it must have been like under Pol Pot. Indescribably brutal, and makes no sense (I'm no fan of Hitler, but at least he \u2026",
          "Great place to learn the recent history of Cambodia. Very informative and moving. Definitely take an audio guide, otherwise you will not get a lot out of your visit. It's a good idea to combine it with the killing fields - both places complement each other.",
          "The audio guide and the exhibition are well organized.  Multi langual audio guide are available (English, Chinese)",
          "Good place to visit. Harrowing photos and history which brings home the downside of the war times",
          "I wish everyone could see this place from the inside. Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn warned us about the dangers of communism in The Gulag Archipelago. Sadly, we haven't learned our lesson. The people who vouch for socialism or communism are the ones who need to come here the most. A very humbling experience.",
          "Rich in history although it\u2019s a really dark place. May their soul rip",
          "One of must-visit place in Phnom Penh. Here, we learn a lot about the history of Khmer Rouge. The museum staffs will hand you an audio guide, which is super helpful for the visitor to have a better understanding of the place. It was not easy to see all of the stories; it\u2019s depressing and sad. But this place is also rich in history.",
          "Everyone must see this.\n\nA harrowing, extremely important place to see for everyone. \n\nThe museum is incredibly well done. They have left the buildings in horrific examples of how they were when this prison was one of the main torture sites \u2026",
          "A very emotional place. Touching. To be visited with respect and empathy. I still of my visit weeks after. Man is capable of the best as of the worst. Don\u2019t be one of those who takes smiling selfies where so many have suffered.",
          "So informative and eye-opening. A must see place in Phnom Penh. Also be sure to rent the audio guide as there are minimal information signs - the full ticket including the audio guide is $8 - well worth the price.",
          "S-21 is a must-see!! If we don't learn from history, we're doomed to repeat it. I highly recommend one takes the time to visit this memorial and pay respect to these people who lost their lives through no fault of their own.",
          "It's an important place to visit. I struggled a bit with the audio, found out afterwards I could have made it go faster.  This place would benefit from having the labels printed again?  I did not like that primary school aged children were watching pictures of torture and listening to the same audio as their parents.",
          "It is worth visiting Cambodia just to see these places, I have had a few days spent here that I will remember all my life, I have found many things that have impressed and touched me, the services offered are excellent and the prices are much better than I expected.",
          "Sad feeling to go this place. No one will greet or look at each other. But is good to know their history.",
          "Must be experienced to see the true horrors the people and country endured during those terrible times. I used the audio tour and it was very worthwhile",
          "Well it's a must see place. But the place is very emotionally intense.",
          "Very worthwhile visit. Frozen in time, the history here was harrowing, informative and important to see. There was a room dedicated to air conditioning (we didn't use it) which was a nice touch, especially on a hot day. A must-see in Phnom Penh.",
          "Wow a very alarming place to view an area which was the largest \"place\" for the inhumane treatment committed by Khmer Rouge.  One of the worse atrocities in modern history (2 or 3). One of two places visited and reason to come to city in \u2026",
          "You have the option of strolling through the museum by yourself or with a headset which guides you through the museum telling you about the history of the place. Some areas were a little hard to listen but it was nice to know the history of the museum.",
          "A very informative museum which documents the terrors that went on behind the walls of S21. I thought the audio guide was excellent, plenty of information and you have the opportunity to walk through each building at your own pace. \n\nSome images and areas are confronting but necessary to visit in order to fully understand the history.",
          "A place to think what is humanity. Five stars in memory of the victims.",
          "What an amazing experience. The museum brings goosebumps to your skin and sends a chill down your spine. It is both terrifying and moving. You owe it to yourself to visit and learn more about the history of the Khmer Rouge and the Cambodian \u2026",
          "Really great way to get a better understanding of Cambodia\u2019s recent history. It is very touristy but I think they\u2019ve done a fair job of memorializing the importance of what has occurred. Entrance is $5 for foreigner or $8 with an audio \u2026",
          "With being of an age where I can remember the news reports of what happened this museum made it all the more horrendous. The thought of Cambodians torturing and murdering their own people seems so hard to believe but it did happen. The \u2026",
          "We visited here at the start of our trip for the students to learn the grim reality of Cambodia\u2019s history. It has been kept in a way to teach guest via reading the signs or listening to audio sets. It\u2019s very confronting but totally worth a visit. It is also good to hear from survivors and you can purchase a book or two.",
          "Get the audio tour, it's worth it. Harrowing but interesting to learn about.",
          "Great audio tour.  Plan to give yourself 2.5 to 3 hours to listen to the entire audio tour.",
          "Here you can learn the story of the notorious prison. There're 3-4 buildings with exhibitions in some room. One of the 4 (?) surviving prisoners gave an autograph for visitors who buy the book about the prison.",
          "I am very pleased that we have done these tours; they have been very well organized, I recommend a personal guide, we had an extraordinary one, I spent 5 days here with the whole family and it was a very good experience, I highly recommend The Killing field and S21 Tour!",
          "Audio guide worth it for expanding upon the history. Powerful memorial.",
          "Hard to contemplate and couldn't imagine those people who were tortured at that time. Seeing those photographs, chambers and tortured materials and blood stains had brought fear in me. Knowing that it was only a few decades ago, I could say \u2026",
          "I did Angkor Wat for 2 days before coming here, then was back to Angkor Wat for another day. It gave me a very different prospective and was able to see more of the history while admiring the temples. I would recommend the audio package as it is offered in various languages.",
          "Nothing to add but that it is a hair-raising experience to walk through the museum. Make sure you get the audio guide (3usd more) as the information boards do not do justice.",
          "SPEECHLESS. you NEED to get the headset to experience this museum. The first step I took into the building while listening to the headset , I had shivers and tears came. I couldn\u2019t help it. Extremely touching and the head set does a great job at creating image in your head.",
          "There's not much to like here considering what it is but it's a well kept museum and with our tour guide it was shocking to hear the history knowing it has not been this long ago. May we not forget what humankind is capable of.",
          "I recommend getting an audio guide. I didn't and regretted it",
          "We had an exceptional guide for this visit.  You can also get audio guides. It's a sombre, thought-provoking experience but so important that the world knows about the atrocities perpetrated by Pol Pot and the Khmer Rouge.  If you visit Phnom Penh you really must visit this museum before you leave.",
          "It brings people into deep thoughts about humane disaster and that we should respect lives.",
          "The Cambodian genocide (Khmer: \u17a0\u17b6\u1799\u1793\u1797\u17b6\u1796\u1781\u17d2\u1798\u17c2\u179a or \u1780\u17b6\u179a\u1794\u17d2\u179a\u179b\u17d0\u1799\u1796\u17bc\u1787\u179f\u17b6\u179f\u1793\u17cd\u1781\u17d2\u1798\u17c2\u179a, French: G\u00e9nocide cambodgien) was carried out by the Khmer Rouge regime under the leadership of Pol Pot, and it resulted in the deaths of approximately 1.5 to 2 million \u2026",

          "Must visit experience. Lots of loud tourists. An ex guard was present trying to sell his book which was strange considering he was complicit in murder but no one was engaging with him so with a bit of luck he's slinked  off back into the \u2026",
          "A harrowing experience but well worth it. Get the audio guide... it's essential for understanding the atrocities that happened here. There's a few survivors on hand to tell you first hand what happened to them. An absolute must visit.",

          "Very interesting and sad that people could hurt each other like this. Hopefully never again.",
          "Very interesting story and a must go if you are in Cambodia. The stories is crazy and it seems so far away, even though it was only 50 years ago. \nDo go for the audio tour, if you are interested in the story at least",

          "You cannot miss this if in Phnom Pehn! Definitely get the Audio no question about it. Take it slow expect to spend several hours. The killing fields is the perfect next stop... come here first.",

          "Extremely interesting experience! At this museum I could learned a lot about the genocide in Cambodia during the Khmer Rouge, communist regime, our tour guide Mr. Koem was very kind and very well prepared, his English was very well. I highly recommend this museum, is an unforgettable experience!",

          "A sombering experience that is well worth the visit to Cambodia. It highlights the atrocities conducted in that very place (with potentially graphic images) and throughout Cambodia during the genocide. It's a must visit along with the Killing Fields and a major highlight of our trip to Cambodia.",
          "A reminder to the amount of cruelty humans are capable of. A mind-numbing experience, which brings alive the horrors that took place in this place in the not too distant past. That it is currently a serene, calm place now, makes the \u2026",

          "You should not miss S21 museum when you're in Phnom Penh. And it's really worth to get the audio guide. Otherwise you just wander around without the information. The audioguide gives lot of interesting info, background stories and original audio from people who witnessed the time.",
          "An important place which describes and shows what we humans are capable of doing to each other (The darker side). Retells the story for the many cambodians who couldnt. Very confronting.\n\nDefinetly get the audio tour and save 2.5 - 3 hours \u2026",
          "A very solemn place. Take your time. Be sure to check out the film for more context which runs periodically. When I was there you could meet and speak to 2 of the survivors.",

          "I've done this tour solo, chilling audiotour to do given that the buildings and interiors have been left unchanged since the fall of the khmer rouge. The ticket price is 8$ and they will give you a handheld device and a pair of headsets, \u2026",
          "If you come to Cambodia and don't visit this place or the killing fields you're neglecting an opportunity to truly understand what has happened here.  I was also privileged to meet Chum Mey at the end of my tour.  He is just one of the few \u2026",
          "The audio tours on the headphones were really imformative. I Liked how you could get more info on the stories if you want to. Or just do main points. Quite intense if you so on the same day as the killing fields, which most people do, but important to visit",
          "A worthwhile visit to understand the context of Cambodia.  Well presented museum. I recommend taking the audio tour option.  We didn't but we were with a tour guide.  I think the audio would have been more detailed",

          "For all of it's grim appearance and history, this is still one of the most compelling things to do whilst visiting Phnom Penh. Set in an old school building this museum was the actual site of a notorious secret prison and torture centre. \u2026",
          "A must visit in Phnom Penh to understand a very dark chapter in the Cambodian history.",

          "A hard but necessary visit.\nThe museum shows the years of suffering in prison during the Khmer Rouge. \nThe energy is heavy. The photos are shocking. You can still see blood on the floor.\nBut it is important to know the story and understand \u2026",

          "Grim, but necessary to learn about. Humanity at its worst.",
          "A must do if you ever go to Cambodia! If you have only time for one thing and its either s21 or the killing fields, i would totally recommend going to the S21! Incredibly interesting!

          "Seeing is believing. This memorial is extremely moving and vitally important in understanding Cambodia.",
          "Great, sad place. Definitely get the audio guide. If you are coming here on a tour that combines the museum with the killing fields, try to pick a tour that starts with the killing fields, as the time they allow in the museum is not enough if you want to explore everything. I stayed for 2.5 hours - but everyone is different.",
          "This place is one of the most important places in Cambodia history. The best part of this place is that they left most of the things as back in they days they left behind. The place have such a emotional feeling because of the bad things \u2026",

          "Grim reminder of mans capability for evil.",
          "Really interesting visit. A little expensive by local standards but worth it to get a sense of the attrocities commited here not so long ago. Although the sombre atmosphere is an experience by itself it is worth getting the audio guide as info without it is a little sparse. ($5 ticket and $3 audio guide at the time of this review)",
          "This is a must visit spot in your trip to Nhom Pen.  Remember that in the 70\u2019s 25% of the Cambodian population was murdered by the Pol Pot regime and this is an iconic landmark of that brutality.  This was a school building transformed into \u2026",

          "I liked it! I don\u2019t wanna see all the pain as it\u2019s presented at the \u2018killing fields\u2019, that is too much for me! Foul Sleng is more discrete, but it\u2019s not hiding the pain... go and see for yourself!",
          "Very tragic history.,......... All memories well maintained. But very heart touching.",
          "A place where many dreams of many simple humans were shattered with torture... A place to remind every human to care about other human and life...",
          "Before being transported by truck to the Killing Fields, prisoners were held and tortured in camps like these.... Madness...",
          "If you have strong heart and interest in history, do visit this place. You need approximately 2-3 hr to go through the details of this place.

          "Take the audio tour and be prepared to be angry, sad and to carry the message of peace with you.",
          "Very informative, but also disturbing. Must see when in PP.",
          "Excellent museum portrayed with respect and dignity. It took us about 3 hours to go through the place, but you could spend longer. \n\nThey are showing \u201cThe Killing Fields\u201d documentary at 9am. And a different one at 15.45.",
          "This is a beautiful and heartbreaking museum of incredible importance. Please take the time to visit and take the audio tour. It's only 8 USD and gives you something invaluable in return. We should all take the time to learn this history \u2026",
          "Painful piece of history well documented. Take the audio tour of 8$ which takes one really close to the dreadful past. Audio device available in multiple languages. Every room & every wall has a story to tell. Will need at least 90 min to hear all audio clips in detail",

          "Respectful and interesting museum about the horrors of the Khmer Rouge. It will be very confronting for some people.",
          "Really cool. Definitely, buy the audio guide because without it is worthless...no cant understand anything because there are no signs.",
          "A symbolic place where you can understand how bad people can be and will see how these bad people are supported by \"democratic\" Western nations. Impossible to understand how these nice people are subjected to this crime. Really sad.",
          "It was really hard to be there, but is a place that you have to visit to learn more about the history, culture and political situation of this country... I recommend to ask for guides, they will help you to understand more about the place and will explain you with details about the pictures and objects inside.",
          "S21 is well worth a visit. Phnom Penh is a relatively boring city if you are coming as a spoilt Westerner, but the history to be found there will shape your experience of Cambodia and the Khmer people. The drive to Tuol Sleng will give you \u2026",
          "A place for the memory of khmer genocid",
          "Touristic, but still a must visit for anyone who is keen to better understand Cambodia's recent past. The audio guide gives the full picture -- worth spending the few extra bucks. \n\nWill genocide happen again if we all remembered what it brings about? Can one tell when ideals start to decline towards a nightmare?",
          "Its a difficult place to visit with so much sadness for so many atrocities that occurred here but to understand Cambodia's recent history you should visit and remember those lost.

          "TRULY EXCELLENT. DO NOT MISS THIS!!!! I have done a lot of tourist things during my time in Asia and I am interested in social history specifically the Cambodian genocide being one of the reasons I wanted to come to Cambodia in the first \u2026",
          "This place has its own atmosphere, pictures and stories help a lot but I suggest to use the audio guide as well.",
          "Very intense and sad stories. You can see blood, hole made by bullets, private cells and a good chance to understand better this horrible time at Cambodia.\n\nBut, if you go to Cambodia, you need to do that. It\u2019s like an way to remember and to learn to be (always) an better person",
          "As with the Killing Fields today, this place presents the facts and information in an accessible way but to me lacked something- I did not get the expected feeling of... what did I expect? I don't know but it lacked something. Maybe it was me. However, must be visited to learn the horrific history.",
          "This museum is so intense and worth to visit. It describe the real recent history of the nation. Tickets is not so expensive but it might be a load in your pocket if you're on budget backpacking.\n\nTicket is $5 without headphones and $8 with \u2026",
          "Very special place in this area of unforgettable things and a must as experience during your stay in Cambodia. Some of the rooms are a bit too much for everyone but for those who are keen to figure out the facts behind is genocide it's a interesting place to see. A must for everyone to learn and memorize this terror.",
          "A must see in Phnom Penh. Clearly explains,  sometimes in a crude way, what the stupidity of a few men acting for a so called revolution can produce when it becomes uncontrolled. You end up disgusted, angry and revolted against those monsters who created that.",
          "A fantastic insight into Khmer history.\n\n$8 entrance for adults with audio guide, $5 without. I\u2019d highly recommend getting the guide it\u2019s very informative and moving.\n\nThere are four buildings. The first building shows the rooms in which \u2026",
          "Very interesting experience to learn about life during the Khmer regime",

          "Absolute overwhelming experience. The history of this place is so dark and horrible that one must be prepared to enter and listen to the audio tapes. At the same time it is necessary for every human being to see this.",
          "Highly recommend if you want to learn more about Cambodias history. Walking through here with the headsets is so informative and emotional with stories from real people giving you so much perspective on what happened. Also really cheap, money well spent.",
          "Incredible interesting place. A must see when in Phnom Penh. Must never forget which cruelties mankind can inflict to others.",
          "It costs 2 or 3 dollars more, but be sure to get the audio tour. There isn't a ton of written information explaining the museum or the various exhibits. Also, the audio tour is very well done and contains audio clips from survivors, family \u2026",
          "Sharp reminder off human cruelty.",

          "A must visit when in Phnom Penh. Definitely get the audio guide, it's excellent, there are not many information boards throughout the museum so you won't understand much without the guide. I'd recommend going to visit the killing fields after the most museum.",
          "Well documented history of Cambodia.  The photos and the establishment are shocking, so be mentally prepared.   Audio guide is worth the time to listen to.  The complete audio tour would probably take up around 1.5 hour.  Entrance fee is 8USD cash only per person including the audio guide.",
          "It\u2019s such a human story: people suffered, but people prevailed in the end. Oppression doesn\u2019t go unpunished. And people like Bou Meng are the real winners. People of Cambodia is the winner. Humanity is the winner. I pray the same for all \u2026",
          "Definitely worth a visit to learn about what happened here.",
          "Such an eye opening experience. I paid the additional $3 for the audio and was not disappointed.",

          "Must see if you come to visit. Took about 2 hours to go through all of it. Killing fields only take about 1 hour but the trip there and back from central is about 2x40 minutes. I'd recommend going here before you visit the killing fields since more background is given at Tuol Sleng.",
          "Very sad place but people need to know what Kemer Rouge did to his own people",
          "Superb audio tour. It's only a few dollars extra but so worth it to get the full context of what you're seeing. There's minimal descriptions inside.",
          "An unmissable experience. Very sad to see all what happened there but necessary to visit and know it if you visit Phnom Penh, it must never happen again.

          "Can not describe the feeling here. I will recommend people come here .",
          "Do NOT miss this prison museum when in Phnom Penh. 2 of the survivors are regularly there to tell their histories. \nI recommend going to the Killing Fields as well, where the prisoners were sent after interrogation at the prison.",

          "I picked up the headphones for my audio your and it was as if I was transported back in time to witness the inhumane and gory treatment of people by the pol pot regime. It is astonishing that even a wrong idea can survive so long and \u2026",
          "This place awakens reflection. Ok, this is not a commercial touristic attraction, but if you are interested in history it's definitely worth to see.

          "What was a high school, then a prison and scene of so much torture, is once again a place for educating people, this time on this awful period in Cambodian history. Rent the audio guide, and take time to listen to every segment if you can, \u2026",
          "This place is a real gem and definitely a must-go for any visitor to Phnom Penh to understand the genocide that happened barely half a century ago. I would definitely recommend opting for the audio guide as it helps in understanding the \u2026",
          "So sad \ud83d\ude25  Humans can be so cruel to each other.  A 'must visit' while you are in Phnom Penh, but brace yourself.  The audio recording is excellent and worth the extra cost.",
          "This place was so emotional. It's a high school that was overtaken by the Khmer rouge to be a ground for torture before they took them out to the killing fields. Evidence of the atrocities are still everywhere and photos are graphic \u2026",

          "Captured the horror of this place, made all the more poignant since the conviction of the last two KR henchman just yesterday. Take an hour or two to look around but it will stay with you for a lot longer after you have left. Do use the \u2026",

          "This museum is very well organised and with the audio guide that's carefully made, the experience is complete. It is hard to believe that in such a peaceful and beautiful oasis of a place in the middle of the city, such horrors happened. A \u2026",

          "Absolute fantastic experience on a par with Auschwitz regarding mans perverse inhumanity to man",

          "Empty rooms not much to see may as well watch the YouTube video",
          "Very sad place, photography are extremely graphic but it is important to remember that there atrocities happened to real people in our recent history, in hopes that it will not be allowed to happen again. \n\nI got the audio tour for and extra $3. It was very informative and I think worth the extra money.",

I felt headache after a while because i felt the photos of the victim look like they are watching back \ud83d\ude2d saw one of the survivor, and buy a book from him, he give his autograph on the book.",
          "There are barrier free slopes for wheelchairs to go around.\nI\u2019ve brought my kids there,6 and 9 years old. It\u2019s a great chance for education if parents can explain the history for them.  I\u2019ve watched documentary with kids named First They \u2026",
          "The killing fields from the Pol Pot Regime. This is definitely an eye opener about the atrocities of the past. Every country has it's past and this is apart of Cambodia's. Left in the state it was found, very inundated and certainly a bit \u2026",

          "Another one of those if your near by it\u2019s worth a quick look. If you miss it don\u2019t swear it! Happy walking!",
          "This is a large monument in the heart of Phnom Penh and is worth visiting. It was built in 1958 to celebrate Cambodia's independence from France. The Monument is sited in the middle of a busy Phnom Penh roundabout, a nice attraction to spend a few minutes at.",
          "There\u2019s traffic all around it so can\u2019t really study it. Something to see when you are going around the city on way to other things",
          "Icon and landmark of phnom penh. I've pass it several times, quite good design and very busy street indeed",
          "Good place to relax lot of people are visiting this place in the evening till night.Its a nice place.",
          "A very nice monument dedicated to the Countries Independence. It sits in the middle of a wide avenue and is adjacent to a park with various things going on in the early evening. There are a number of food stands nearby with local food and at times various activities in the park.",
          "Located at the very busy street. It was a bit cloudy when we arrived and the photos didn\u2019t look so nice. But it is nice to know the story behind this monument. I think it is better to see at night as the lights reflected nicely in the monument.",
          "We had a guide and he explain a bit about this monument. It is nothing special but worth to see it if you are here.",
          "If you're in Phnom Penh, you're probably going to pass this once or twice. Take a walk by in the evening to grab a picture, they have it lit up very nicely. After walking by it, go to the park, great place to walk around.",
          "If you are traveling around Phnom Phen, you'll probably pass by the monument a few times. It is certainly worth a photo or two!",
          "This is an important monument to the people of Cambodia. The 37-metre in height monument was built in 1958 and officially opened in 1962 to celebrate Cambodia\u2019s becoming an independent country. Prior to 1953, it was a territory of France. The structure is a lotus-shaped stupa,",
          "This is a stunning obelisk where I would recommend tourist to stroll around particularly at night time. The lights and sounds are so inviting to take a short time to relax and unwind.",
          "What a stunning site after the rain with all the light. Also, the parks are very clean and safe to walk. Great experience.",
          "It's in city center and better to visit eve to see the lighting. Lacking signal around the monument roads so continuous traffic.stop at front side for photography.",
          "Phnom Penh city is quite boring. When you are taking a tuktuk to just see this monument you know you are desperate for things to do. But the monument is very pretty at night, both at sunset and dark night",
          "Phnom Penh has a large boulevard with many statues and monuments dotted along it. They look impressive from a distance day or night, and provide a photo opportunity but other than that unless you really are into the history or architecture, they offer little by way of an",
          "This place is located at the central of the town. You can go there on the way you go to visit many other place. And really nice on sunny days",
          "This is not really a sight to visit. It is on a large busy roundabout/traffic circle. It is an impressive structure and there are nice gardens nearby. However, you aren\u2019t able to get up close to the monument. It does get lit up at night which makes it look quite nice. You are",
          "Head to 1 km walking/running/rollerblading path in the centre of the road adjacent to the independence monument around 5pm. It\u2019s a great way to see the Phnom Penh locals going about their way doing many of the above activities and also resting, people watching, playing soccer,",
          "This monument is in the middle of a roundabout so you can\u2019t really go there. During the day it\u2019s not really anything special but at night it becomes quite nice and if you\u2019re in the area you should stop by and take a photo.",
          "nothing really fancy there, a busy round-about that you will surely pass by when moving around Phnom Penh. You may notice a large presence of poice and army around the place, this is becasue house of the Prime Minister is just on one of the corner (north side....huge house, you",
          "A must to go place for my family on almost every weekend. Me and my wife enjoy the walk on lovely nice track while my children enjoy their bicycle rides. The water fountains gives a pleasant feeling. Another plus is being very near to my hous e as well as other attractions like",
          "According to the tour guide, the monument was built at the advice of Chinese minister at that time during the Cambodia visit to remember the Kingdom's independence. Chinese have received a lot of respect by the people of Cambodia as China saved Cambodia's King when there was an",
          "Beautiful to look at, but just a pile of expensive rock in a country that probably had better use for its money.",
          "I love to visit. It nice place,specially night time very crowded and it near by Naga Resort, around many restaurants and easy to find foos",
          "A very beautiful monument. Sits in the middle of a very busy roundabout. A beautiful monument though. Passed several times during our exploration. Cambodians should be very proud. I loved seeing this.",
          "We passed the monument during the day and returned at night to see it lit up and the fountains on. A lovely area to visit with another monument to the King in the same strip and other fountains and features.",
          "The PRINCE NORODOM SIANUK statue very nahr of France and Europe father of the nation. Limited power an the RED KMERS 1975-78 PERIOD. Wie remember here the last time of the regne of the king. Nice avenue go to the king palace.Many new building. The city make very big changement",
          "Especially pretty at night when it is lit. It is on a very busy roundabout, so really not easy to \u201cvisit\u201d. Just for having a look.",
          "This is great labdmark of Phnom Penh. It was very nice view at night time with beautiful lighting. You should stop by and take the picture when you are in Phnom Penh.",
          "It's a monument on a main thoroughfare. Hard to miss but not something you are likely to walk up to.",
          "Worth stopping for photos. Better at night if you have a camera with ISO settings for nice photo opportunities. Whist worth a visit if nearby not overly worth going out of your way to see.",
          "A huge monument in the city for their independence. It was a nice landmark to use during sightseeing too.",
          "Beautiful view during the night time. A monument built to commemorate their independence from France. This is NOT a must do in Phnom Penh, but nice to visit if you are in area. Should not take more than 30 mins here.",
          "very close to the hotel , nice to walk around on a evening , familys out walking , children playing football , so relaxed there , so clean , no litter , no dog mess",
          "Builit in 1958 to commemorate Cambodia's independence from France in 1953. It stands on the intersection of Norodom Boulevard and Sihanouk Boulevard in the centre of the city.",
          "This has an imposing presence in the main boulevard of Pnom Penh. Must visit Monument that exhibits beauty with a connection to its host country's independence.",
          "When you see Independence Monument you will get a sense that you are in Cambodia. I prefer Independence Monument at night when the fountains around it are working. They are lit up with changing colored lights which is a bit schlocky, but good for the camera. I could come back",
          "From this place you can go through the park and enjoy night life in Phnom Penh. I recognized in Phnom Penh if you see a shop selling something you can see the same thing they sell in next 10 handcarts. Along this park they sell pop corn and boiling corn.",
          "Very centrally located. Part of big central park area/avenue. Nice decorative architecture monument. Best at night view with magnificent light.",
          "A good place to go and see and have a rest whilst taking a couple of photos but not much else. Nice gardens around it.",
          "You cannot really go and see the monument from up close because of the round about and traffic. It is important monument for Cambodians and looks amazing for night photography.",
          "Each of the Monuments and Memorials listed separately along this parkway lessens the value to be had by combining the significance of the total. This is not particularly attractive painted brown, with a cup in the center. It doesn't add to the nearby Monument to the king. There",
          "a must visit place. walking distance from nagaworld hotel 2. I prefered to come early in the morning less people. great view.we took a lot of photos. the structure was huge.",
          "The monument is highly decorated and very clean. The area around the monument is very clean and well kept. I visited during New Year celebrations so lots of lights and ornate decorations all around, making it purely beautiful.",
          "Stands majestic from a distance. Clever piece of craftmanship by Cambodians. Definitely a must do. Watch out for pick pockets. Hint: good camera, sun hat, sunscreen, try for sunset and sunrise views, suitable footwear and clothing",
          "Delightful to see so many locals using this beautiful area in the evenings. Right in the middle of the city. So clean.",
          "Beautiful driving round this during the night time when well lit up Nice history to read up on as well Visit both times of the day",
          "In a nice setting but this is an average statue of the king who was around when the country gained independence from France colonial rule in the 50s. It had a tramp sleeping in it despite various police and army types standing around with weapons so something is wrong there.",
          "When you see Independence Monument you will get a sense that you are in Cambodia -- not like seeing Angkor Wat, of course, but of a similar order because of the architectural design. Most tourists will see the Monument on a ride around the city in a tuk tuk or bus, but if you",
          "It's just a single monument so not worth going a long distance for the sake of this one thing but can easily be combined with a nice walk towards the waterfront and other places of interest.",
          "If you are in PNH, pls drop by this site for some photos. Especially at night with all the lights in the surroundings, it\u2019s awesome. Be careful when crossing the roads as it\u2019s kind of dangerous.",
          "Go on route to something else, but essentially it's a nice looking monument in the middle of a busy intersection. At night it's impressive looking.",
          "This monument is good for the evening to see the light reflection and it's very place to see. Next to that, it's possible space for local exercise.",
          "cover this place enroute somewhere else for its a monument in the middle of a busy intersection. There are some restaurants around and its a great place for a post dinner walk.",
          "It is better to see this monument at night because it is lit. Daylight does not do this monument any just. Also be sure you are in a good and safe location for photographing this monument as it is on a very busy intersection/roundabout.",
          "Where did you get the money to build all these monuments? How about some street lights or cheaper museum prices. Had to travel through but happy to get out of this stinky, dusty and loud city.",
          "Our driver drove us there just to look at it and took some pictures. It is just a monument of significant as it signified independence from France.",
          "If you are in PP, you should come and visit this place. Nice spot to sit and hangs with friends while enjoying watching the lovely evening in the city.",
          "Our tuk tuk tour stopped at the monument. It was a nice chance to take photos. As I understand the monument is significant because it signifies independence from France",
          ". . . and knowing the history makes it more interesting. (Read other reviews for an intro, then study up or get your driver to explain.) It was en route for some walking and was a nice photo stop. The architecture is impressive. Drove past later and driver told his",
          "The monument is supposed to mean a lot to Cambodia but it didn't show any specific sign or any description about how important it is. It seems like just a big monument in the middle of the road and people are passing by, that's it.",
          "This monument was built in 1958 to celbrate the independence of Cambodia from French rule. Since it is iconic in Phnom Penh, it is worth a picture and short stop.",
          "You will probably pass the Independence Monument while driving through Phnom Penh. It's in the middle of one of the busiest roundabouts in the city. Nothing special to look at. No need to stop.",
          "I walked by multiple times to and from my hotel. Nice place, but busy. You can get nice photos at night.",
          "This is a monument in a park -- so you're going to either drive by or walk through. Great if you have a guide, because you'll hear the pride the Cambodians have in their country.",
          "Nice architecture in good surroundings, easy to get too. Near lots of other attractions. Good for clean photographs.",
          "At evening here is very beautiful and relaxing to walk. A lot of lights and fountains. And at day here is very noisy because of the millions cars and motorbikes.",
          "This is across the street from the stature of king father Norodom sihan. If you are going to see the statue, you will see this too. It is the memorial that celebrates Cambodia's independence from France.",
          "Very pretty picture stop, we did in early evening before it was too dark. Lovely feature and looked after well.",
          "A large statue in the middle of the road this is good to see and even more so in the evening when the lights come on all around.",
          "Definitely worth seeing, especially by walk through the avenue. It shows the progress of Cambodia post-civil war.",
          "Very nice monument, worth making it part of your walk through the city - it\u2019s not far from the Royal Palace and there are some good restaurants nearby (Sovanna and Kravanh being two excellent places we tried).",
          "Just worth it for a photo opportunity , we were going past in a tuk tuk & asked the driver to pull over to take a photo \ud83d\udc4d , not worth a special trip to see",
          "it's like a monument at the central of the city. nice design, and yes as you could see at the picture of the monument profile in this website, the sight at night is beautiful",
          "We went past here in a tuk tuk for $10USD for 20 mins for 4 people. Was fantastic to see in day and night. Driving past was enough.",
          "At night, this monument is especially stunning. It\u2019s a lovely to stroll around the green space in between the boulevards.",
          "You can't help but cross the monument several times if you stay for more thena couple of days in Phnom Penh. Strategically located and a good guide to different avenues criss crossing the city. Well maintained park in front. It is pleasant to walk around in the evenings and",
          "I would not call this a must see, it was behind our hotel and we walked up to have a look. Rather like the monument outside Buckingham Palace in London it is a roundabout, if you can call it that in Cambodia. Beautiful red brick it looks like an Angkor Wat tower and honours the",
          "The place where u get your photo to prove that you are in phnom penh. It walking distance from the riverside. And also a south from bkk area where u can your food shop for disferent verity for internation food in the area.",
          "If you rented a motorcycle, this thing is pretty cool to bike past. Seeing it around 6pm or sunset is nice as the lights start to come on.",
          "Evening time on the two adjoining \"boulevards\" where the 3 main monuments are situated is very special . There are aerobic (line dancing) classes, improvised soccer matches, food wagons and dining areas, people strolling/jogging and generally a nice communal atmosphere.",
          "You cant miss this monument as it is a centerpiece along a popular road. There wasnt enough to make me want to stop and look at it in detail. I may be missing any historical reference but i didnt find it to be anything special.",
          "Very large monument in the heart of the city, no need to make special trip here as you will probably pass it numerous times whilst exploring the city. Looks better at night when all lit up.",
          "We had a nice stroll in the Independence Monument continued to the Friendship Monument on the way to the Royal Palace!",
          "This is right in the centre of the city. And was built to celebrate the independence from the french. It is typically well lit and looks good at night. We can skip this, or just pass through siting in a cab..",
          "Just a monument in a big avenue. It takes 10 minutes to see it and walk around by a pedestrians area special made to walk.",
          "Passed the Independence monument and park a few times everyday as it was on the way to our accommodation, always nice to walk around there rather than on the side walks. In the evening, people do sport around there etc...",
          "Very impressive monument in the center of the city. Hard to miss, since it is huge. In the evening it is more beautiful, as they light it up.",
          "This monument sits in the middle of sihanouk blvd. Easy to access and free but not much to it and much more interesting things to visit.",
          "An impressive monument in the middle of the road. Photos can be taken from the vehicle as you drive past. It's shame that it's not in a park where the visitor can pay proper homage to it.",
          "It was built in the year 1958 to memorialize Cambodia\u2019s independence from France in the year 1953. It stands on the intersection of boulevards in the centre of the city. The structure height is 20 metres or 66 feet. It is in the form of a lotus shaped stupa of Buddhist style.",
          "located in plain sight of the city,nearbty the royal palace and indo china monument. visit early in the morning for a good photo shoot with not so many people",
          "Our Tuk tuk driver was sailing past this monument so we tapped him on the shoulder to indicate we'd like to stop & take a look around. Quite an impressive sight & you can capture quite a vista in your photos if you allow a moment to see what is on offer . Looks great against the",
          "just forget it! not worth a glance. to visit, you have to take a motobike or tuktuk on noisy polluted streets to see a big concrete monument in the center of a vast crossing of different large streets.",
          "It's exactly like in the pics. Nothing much to it in my opinion. You could just drive around it on your way somewhere instead of stopping and getting down.",
          "Majestic monument in the middle of busy traffic. Grab a Tuk Tuk and safely cruise around the center of town.",
          "Definitely has a meaningful presence. Good for a photograph or two. It is in the middle of a roundabout though.",
          "This is a lovely monument which you cannot miss. It is surrounded by busy roads on each far side. Close to the monument is a nice green space and a few chair benches to sit on. There are many tourist buses in the area so trying to get a photo can be a bit of a challenge",
          "And boy did I take a lot of photos in front of this monument as well as from the side views. Prince Sihanouk's mid 60s folly still looks suitably grand and imposing. Besides, it is impossible to take a bad picture of it!",
          "You can see the pictures if you really need to see it in person I doubt your reaction will be much different",
          "I visited this during the day, right bang in the middle of a road, you can walk right up to the building, but most people were taking pictures from opposite road, lovely structure of a building, must see place, would recommend",
          "We went to the killing fields and our tuktuk stopped here for some pictures. Nice statue on an impressive square.",
          "Our visit their independence monument was basically a drive-by still it was beautiful from the van maybe you shouldn\u2019t miss it",
          "Finally a place to walk without being hassled by tuktuk or other sellers. Open clean space makes for great walks at any time of the day.",
          "It's an impressive monument accompanied by a long garden where you can walk. It's quite lovely at night when lit up. Good place for a morning or evening stroll.",
          "A great monument that is lit up at night. It's a shame that it is in the middle of a very busy roundabout so it's tough to just take it in without worrying about all the vehicles!",
          "Open area surrounded by bustling traffic and very busy roundabout with a well lit monument to independence in the centre. We walked there at night and enjoyed the atmosphere and there are some good restaurants nearby as well as street food stalls.",
          "A must see especially if you know the history of Cambodia. Easy to find and nice surrounds. Popular with the locals on Sundays",
          "located at the heart of city, just take a tuk tuk and you can visit anytime. For taking photos better visit at evening time.",
          "This monument ia interesting and picturesque, part of a cluster in central Phnom Penh. It is slightly difficult to get closer access to due to it being surrounded by a busy road network, which perhaps limits the visitors it gets.",
          "It\u2019s a landmark in the truest sense as it gives you a central place in the city. It\u2019s useful if you have to direct a tuk tuk, or tell somebody where something is. It\u2019s also pretty enough to see as you walk by, but that\u2019s about it. It\u2019s not easy to get to since it\u2019s in the middle",
          "An important landmark in Phnom Penh and a popular place for locals to exercise in the early morning or evening. Mornings will see exercise classes, aerobic groups and even some form of ti chi",
          "We had a great time with beautiful eyes to visit this Independence Monument of Cambodia where the building built dedicate to whom devoted their lives for nation. And they are real compatriots for all of Cambodian remembrance.",
          "This is an imposing tower built of dark red sandstone and sits in the middle of a large busy roundabout. You can\u2019t get in as the exits are roped off. It is of local significance but to me it was just a big tower!",
          "Wonderfull place . And worth seeing at night time . Makes much bigger impression that day time. Quite a central location in town.",
          "We stopped part of the tour. Nice place, right in the middle of the city. Good to see the local kids/families there, and their lives.",
          "This is symbol of Cambodia independence, nothing to see inside except to take a round of building. Good decoration and very clean lawn to sit in evening.",
          "One of the landmarks of the capital Phnom Penh. Ideal for photography. The superb lighting changes the color of the monument. A must visit in the evening.",
          "There is not much to this monument visit which is located at the centre of several roads leading to it. Best time to visit it is after dark at night when the monument is lit up. Suggestion is go for to boat cruise on Tonle Sap river (we took Kanika boat) and then stroll to the",
          "The monument is pretty much in the middle of phnom penh and was around the corner of our hotel. It looks nice especialy lit up at night.",
          "Yes its nice. And new. Everything around also very clean and nice. That\u2018s it. Nothing special, not a must see...",
          "I was driven by it and thought it was beautiful, but I did not stop to see it being in the middle of a turnabout. Celebrates independence from France or at least that is what showed when my local friend used Google translate",
          "Centrally located and well lit at night, shows the dates and other information of the terrible Khmer rouge rein",
          "Its no more than a quick look at and a nice photo of this lovely monument , but that's to be expected",
          "Take a walk around the square , at night or day, it's beautiful! Many people walk or jog along here throughout the day",
          "A nice part with a lot of locals either running, playing or just sitting on the grass talking with friends! The monument is nice specially when is dark!",
          "Worth coming to see in the day - although often swarmed over by buses of tour groups, but it is very pretty at night when it is all lit up",
          "Its a monument in the middle of a roundabout. Either take a look from your tuk tuk as you drive around or get out to take a photo.......simples \ud83d\udc4d",
          "The monument stays in the middle of roundabout, so you can not come near. It looks very simple, but nice.",
          "Very grand looking at night with lighting at the present time in the surrounding trees. You can't miss it as it's quite massive",
          "We've passed through the monument several times but it looks better at night. The design is great but as it is placed in the round-about, it is quite difficult to stay and take pictures especially when the traffic flow is heavy. It's a monument that carries great symbol and",
          "We did a quick stop here at the monument and took some photos. We are unsure of the history around this but we think it symbolic of the freedom from 100 years of French colonialism. There is a picture of the former president beside the monument but it had the wrong dates as says",
          "Symbolic great value, and the design is nice. It is a landmark for Phnom Penh but can easily be skipped. During the day the traffic is just insane as is the pollution. The building and surrounding areas are beautifully lit at night!!! Would surely make a detour at night to see",
          "It's an important piece of Cambodian history and it's pretty as far as monuments as this go. But nothing more. It's on a roundabout so have your tuktuk driver make a full circle and make him stop for the mandatory picture and off you go.",
          "If you are taking a walk along the avenue, especially at night when all the locals are on their nocturnal wander & the lights sparkle in the trees, then the monument is nice to see as you pass. But it is basically just a large statue to the previous King, with no information, so",
          "Drive past it every chance you get, you'll spot something new each time. Located on a round about so stopping is hard.",
          "Very impressive monument best seen at night. To be fair we visited at the last night of there annual Independence Day celebrations. So lots of fire works",
          "Located in central Phnom Penh, a roundabout where always seems heavy traffic. Hard to get close to it, but take photos from across the park where you can also see a statue of King Father Norodom Sihanouk.",
          "The monument stands between Norodom Boulevard and Sihanouk Boulevard in the centre of the city.The monument is said to be built in the Angkorian style. This is an impressive structure consisting of five levels decorated with 100 snake heads. Independence Monument was built in",
          "Stunning at night but difficult to cross the road at the crazy round about to actually get to it. The monument is simply that and nothing else so across the road from the actual monument is the best spot for a pic.",
          "We saw he monument whilst passing in a tuk tuk. It\u2019s located on a roundabout so the best way to see it and take photos is to go round the roundabout in a tuk tuk.",
          "This looks spectacular at night and worth a look. There are guards nearby with big machine guns who are not keen for a photo! Worth a look",
          "This monument was in the middle of perhaps the busiest roundabout in Phnom Penh. It was a very recognisable landmark, but was extremely difficult to get to on foot, as there were vehicles coming from all directions. Try and get up close if you're able to, without losing your",
          "There is not much but just a monument there. The closest attraction is Naga Casino and the Mekong river",
          "It's boring in the day light but beautiful in the night light. Don't forget your camera with you! ;)",
          "This place happens to be right in the middle of the city which connects the other tourist attractions with places of stay and thus one would end up there by default. We didn't spend time at the place but for visiting there on a tuk tuk. Holds lot of significance for the country",
          "The independence monument is pretty to look at and when you think of all the trauma this represents, it gave me a shudder,",
          "The view of the monument at night is nice coupled with dazzling vehicles flow. There is a park in the vicinity which can be explored.",
          "Take a Tuk Tuk to see it at night all in lights and the trees are in lights very pretty. I would suggest going in the early morning too because it does get very hot.",
          "Built in 1958 as a memorial to Cambodia's independence from France in 1953. Independence Monument is designed in a Angkorian style, shaped as a lotus temple stupa that consist of five levels and every level is decorated with snake heads. The monument is at it's most impressive",
          "Nothing special, just another of hundreds of monuments in Asia. Set in the middle of a large busy roundabout.",
          "Nice place to take pictures. It is right in the middle of a busy junction so be careful while taking the pictures. This monument looks great when it is fully lit on few days during the evening.",
          "Only interesting to know what it is when you pass by. If you don't pass, you don't really have to go there to visit it.",
          "Everything is in the title! Anyway, since the monument is located on a key place in Phnom Penh, you will certainly have the opportunity to pass close to it.",
          "This is a fairly average looking monument located in the centre of a giant traffic roundabout in downtown Phnom Penh. Getting across to the monument requires a certain level of courage as there really can be a lot of traffic here. Visiting on a weekend probably helps as you just",
          "We visited during a nighttime wander of Phnom Penh. Very grand structure which sits tall amongst the surrounding streets.",
          "good to see at night the area is a nice tuk tuk ride with some one special a lot to see in Cambodia .",
          "When lit up at night and a great place to just sit and people watch and marvel at the tuk tuk drivers and those on mopeds who despite the apparent carnage seem to avoid each other Be wary at night crossing the road though as the city is sadly notorious for drink driving and",
          "The symbol of the Kingdom\u2019s Indepence, it\u2019s one of the must see places when visiting the capital. The park nearby is a great place for an afternoon walk. The monument is lighted up with colored lights in evening and the fountain is up during holidays and special occassion.",
          "Nothing too impressive, but obviously means a lot to the Cambodian people. Newly built it lacks the grandeur of more histoeic cultural sites, but is still definitely worth a quick stop.",
          "NIce and close and easy to see. Cambodians very proud of their monument. My tuk tuk driver was very emotional about it.",
          "The independence monument is a quite nice monument on a nice boulevard. It is kinda chaotic in the evening with a lot of cars and scooters driving around, but it is also a good vantage point when you walk around the city.",
          "I saw this from the tuk-tuk when the driver pointed it out. Took a quick pic and kept going. There are other things to see and do that are a better use of your time in Phnom Penh",
          "A beautiful and picturesque monument in the center of the city. It is free to view and an excellent representation of Cambodian architecture.",
          "in the middle of the biggest roundabout where norodom intersects preah sihanouk blvd...more beautiful at night as many lights illuminate it.",
          "Not a whole lot to do here, but worth going to for sure. Quite the impressive monument, and a bustling area in the city!",
          "This monument in the heart of Phnom Phen depcits or represents the indpencence of Cambodia. Free to view it is set in a park however is in the middle of a busy intersection. Your journey around Phnom Phen will likely take you past this attraction.",
          "It is just a monument on a roundabout, no added extras. But it is very beautiful and commentates Cambodian independence from France. It lies at the centre of the city so well worth a pause to enjoy!",
          "If you're wandering around Phnom Penh, it's impossible to miss this monument. Sat in the centre of one of the busiest roundabouts in the city, it's worth taking a few minutes to have a look at and take a few happy snaps, particularly if you get there around sunrise or sunset.",
          "Cool Monument, can see from your car.. other than that don't make a trip just to see it. Think about what it represents and appreciate what it stands for..",
          "This monument marks one end of Norodom Boulevard. No need to make this a specific get to place, as you will more than likely pass it several times while seeing our sights. The roundabout traffic is hectic so don't be expecting any solemn ambience. Encourage visitors to walk the",
          "Another impressive monument in Phnom Penh, but no need to hop out of your tuktuk and try to navigate through the traffic to get a better look.",
          "You should just drive by it. It is beautiful, with some incredible history behind it but I wouldn't recommend stopping in the middle of a roundabout and take a look. It's still beautiful even while driving past it on your way to the palace.",
          "There's really nothing special about this monument but I think it's the Khmer style. I've seen other similar around the country",
          "There really isn't anything too special. You can photo is from anywhere on the roundabout but you can't get up close unless your driving round the roundabout. Saw it both day and night - both views were good. You're bound to pass it at some point during your stay in the city.",
          "Easygoing didn't cost anything to go there the locals gather around at night and dance great to watch close to restaurants and the water front all flat easy walking",
          "Traveling around Phnom Penh, one is bound to pass this monument many times, and yet even just casually passing by I am always inspired by its simple, spiritual elegance in honor of the human desire to be free. It evokes the past while offering inspiration for the future.",
          "Like much if the old architecture in Cambodia, the skill and creativity of the monument is amazing. We visited at night when it was all lit up. Stunning",
          "It's kind of hard to travel to Phnom Penh without coming across the Independence monument at least once or twice, and as the name implies, it's a monument and nothing much to see, but a nice spot to take a photo and then move along. Don't get me wrong, it's pretty and beautiful,",
          "Grab a tuk tuk and drive past at night they will stop for a photo it's very pretty and shows the intricacies of the architecture.",
          "The monument is very nice to see. We wandered past as it was on our way to dinner. It is nice to walk through the two large park areas between the royal palace and the monument. The monument itself is a round-a-bout, so you can't get up close to it. It was nice to see on our",
          "No need to stop and look at the Monument during the heat of the day, driving by will get you all yoy need. But if you do plan to visit and take photos, go during sunset as you'll get phenomenal colors in the sky and pair that with the beautiful Monument = a beautiful moment!",
          "Just some monuments at the park. Only go if u have time and you will finish walking one end to the other end on foot in 15 mins. No entrance fee is required.",
          "I would recommend to visit this monument at night, if you want to get some nice pictures. Located near the riverside and easy to access.",
          "I visited in the evening to take a night shot of the monument. It is pretty, also together with the other monument. It is hard however to cross the street at that time, as not only a lot of scooter are driving, but also a continuous line of cars at pretty high speed. There is no",
          "Impressive monument based on Angkor Wat shapes. Well highlighted and lit at dusk or night, and therefore best visited both during the day, and after sunset.",
          "A massive monument to Cambodia's independence in the broad park-like median of bustling Sihanouk Blvd. It's a \"must-see\" even though it won't take long. Stop by the memorial to King Sihanouk nearby, too. Popular locations for locals to shoot, for example, their graduation",
          "Built in 1958, It is a nice monument,we didn't spend a lot of time near it but it was great to visit and have some photos taken!!",
          "I can never get too lost as I use this beautiful Monument to locate where I am in this bustling city. It is especially pretty at night in how well it is lite up - an beautiful spot in Phenom Penh and it is located near the President's house -",
          "No more than a modern stupa in angkorian style. Nice at the evening when you can sit in one of the food stand around the enormous intersection of which the monument is the centre.",
          "The monument is located on a roundabout, there is no way to reach it so it can be seen only from across the road. It is a cool monument but it has nothing really special about it. Max you can spend around it is 5 minutes, just to take 2 pictures.",
          "This photo stop was included in our cyclo tour of the city. It is a stunning monument which is well worth seeing.",
          "Nice to drive past in your tuktuk but that's about it. Good for a photo but don't go out of your way to go there. Not much around it except swarms ofctraffix.",
          "It's a landmark. Am important landmark that has made its way into the Phnom Penh geofilter on Snapchat. Is it worth stopping here? No. Why? Because you're going to cross this monument several times when you're in your tuk tuk or your motto and well... it's a one dimensional",
          "This is the land mark of Phnom Penh so you should visit this monument and also the statue of King Norodom Sihanouk in front of it. Best to see at night, especially after rain.",
          "Just walking around the city after having traditional performance at museum, it was nice walk at night from the nearby King's monument while watching people sitting and walking along the avenue. There are several police guarding nearby around the monuments, probably for some",
          "It was fine just taking it in wuth a drive through though. We passed it in the way to S21 and recognized it. I am not sure if you can even walk round it.",
          "We visited this site in the evening and it was quiet and relaxed. The history attached to this site reminds us of similar structures in other cities around the world. Our guide was full of passion and patriotism when we were discussing this monument with him.",
          "We stopped here to learn more from our guide about the history of the city. This monument is very symbolic to Cambodians. Great fresh coconuts from the roadside vendor, also!",
          "This monument is one of the very few structures (if we can call it that) that is meticulously maintained on a yearly basis. It is also the venue where HRH the King makes his speech during his commemoration day (which is a public holiday) to students who would congregate here",
          "This monument both commemorates Cambodia's independence from France in 1953 and honors their citizens lost in war. It is inspired by the central tower of Angkor Wat. You really can't miss the monument while in Phnom Penh as it is in the center of a busy street.",
          "Just a bit of fun to watch the locals at play and picnic. Nothing much to see really and more impressive at night but an important landmark on festival days.",
          "I asked my tuk tuk driver to drive by and took pictures. It is not a place like where you need more time to spend, you won't miss it because of its proximity to Naga World and central location.",
          "When riding by tuktuk tell your driver to just drive by. Have a look while passing or just make a short stop while going to the royal palace. It's a nice monument but not very impressive in my opinion.",
          "This is the independent monument located centrally in the capital city of Cambodia ,This has a nice view at night with big round about and near to man-gong river.",
          "Found on sihounk Blvd about 7 minutes from Riverside Phnom Penh Cambodia . Opposite you will find the Cambodian prime ministers mansion and North Korean embassy . Take a bottle of water with you.",
          "A lovely place to visit to see the vast cultural differences of our two countries. A must see if you are visiting the country.",
          "It's not the coolest or grandest of monuments, but it is an interesting piece of architecture and you might as well get a picture with it since you're here! Try and stay on the grassy park area that's on the other side of the street from the monument. It'll be a lot safer",
          "This monument is devoted to the Cambodian independence from France in 1960s. It was a great event, and no wonder this magnificent monument reminds it. It is not possible to ignore it walking in Phnom Penh especially during sunset time.",
          "Usually just referred to as the monument, it is in the middle of everything, at the junction of busy Norodom and Sihanouk Boulevards. You will pass it many times during your visit to Phnom Pehn. Most impressive when lighted at night. (Visited 2011-13.)",
          "Just be careful getting anywhere closer to that monument, I think you are safer at a very far distance because the traffic is insane. Defs go at night for a stunning view",
          "This imposing monument is well worth a visit either at night or during the day. At night it is at the heart of the local's after-hours social activities and looks amazing all it up.",
          "The monument celebrates the nation's independence from France. It stands 20 meters tall and was built between 1958 and 1962. It is shaped like a lotus like stupa and was designed by the Cambodian architect Vann Molyvann",
          "History Monument in heart of city, stand in middle of beautiful place around by relaxation garden. Independence monument very greatest designed idea.",
          "The carving is great and it looks awesome at night but its located in the centre of the a median strip down the centre of a major road. You can see it from the tuk tuk or car and also from the many roof top bars. Personally I wouldnt make a specific trip to see it.",
          "It is a big monument in the middle of a big roundabout, not much more than that. It certainly is a landmark in Phnom Penh, but it is not a \"visitable\" place, just a pass by spot. The boulevard at Preah Sihanouk starting from the monument is okay, a walkable place.",
          "This is an interesting structure. There is very little else to report on this. It's just an interesting to look at structure.",
          "This monument is a great bit of architecture just go have a look as you walk round Phnom Penh if you like stuff like that",
          "I went there with my family and it was really refreshing. There is this Independent Monument and along with it is a park , which is located right in front of it. It's really wonderful. The night view of the sky from the park is breathtaking. I would totally suggest people to go",
          "Our tuk tuk driver stopped off on the way to the Killing Fields to allow us to see this. It doesn't take long to see this attraction.",
          "Independence Monument is typical of these sort if monuments, located in the center of a traffic circle.",
          "Best way to see this is by tuk tuk doing a drive by photo shoot. The roads are busy and there is little else to do around the site.",
          "This is like a huge structure in the centre of the city. The surroundings & liveliness near this place is very good & you can easily spend couple of hours exploring all the nearby lanes",
          "Located on a very very busy roundabout. Nice to see as a main landmark of the city but no need to hang around for long as there's nothing else there to see once you take your photos. Take a Tuk Tuk to drive past that's your best way to view it.",
          "Located in the center of the main boulevard, this is one of the landmarks of Phnom Penh. It is beautiful during the day and at night and it is hard to miss.",
          "It is right in the centre of the road. Must be patient when taking photos as vehicles would pass by every now and then. Had nice photo though.",
          "Chances are you'll drive by - NO NEED TO VISIT! Really! It's pretty at night time but there's nothing to see by stopping so have your camera out (but not snatchable by passing motos) to snap some shots!",
          "The monument is a blast! Powerful and grace. Very well preserved. The only thing that I found difficult is to across the plaza and get there. Cars, bikes, tuktuks, motorcycles; all coming on a non stop way. Nice pictures and history",
          "I walked to there from my hotel. The momentum is in the middle of a roundabout but the area around it is quite nice and well laid out and there are some other interesting statues etc to see",
          "We visited the monument at night and it looked spectacular. The roads don't have much traffic and absolutely no noise. We sat in a park nearby and just observed for good half an hour before cycling away If you don\u2019t have much time you can even miss this one.",
          "The monument itself isn't that big of a deal but it is in this area a lot is happening at night so you should pay it a visit",
          "During the day, it is a common tower. But at night, it rises up among others. It becomes a neck-turner.",
          "Hired tuk tuk driver Sarwar to drive us around so he took as places and one of them was this monument. Pretty impressive monument we must say.",
          "We stayed within walking distance from the independence monument. After Dinner, we walk passed the junction and have a good look at the monument. It was light up and is really a good spot for camera.",
          "This pagoda is right in the heart of the Riverside area. Another Buddhist temple with a number of Buddha images, a peaceful place in a manic area. Worth a visit as it is one of the most important Buddha places in PP.",
          "This is a main route in the city to the river area. It is a place where a lot of activities take place. There are lots of eating and drinking places near this venue. Great place to experience the local people as Sunday is free for all dance at the venue and lots of eating stalls",
          "The monument is open 24hours and has free entry. There is no restriction of clothing either. We were able to see it from our hotels roof top so decided to walk it up. It's a lotus shaped stupa, similar to the architecture at Angkor wat. the grounds surrounding the monument are",
          "It's very near to the Statue of King Father Norodom Sihanouk which is situated in a square. It doesen't take to much time to visit it and it is worth visiting. If you can choose to visit both on the late afternoon/night (by sunset).",
          "In the city center and must see photo op for Phnom Penh. Walk to many other attractions and plenty of good restaurants or cup of coffee and sit in the park. The area is clean and good for just relaxing. Lite up in the evening is very beautiful.",
          "The best part of independence monument is the people -- out exercising and just hanging out! Early morning _ like around 6 a.m. _ or at sunset are the best times as this place can get hot. Also in the evening there are many food vendors",
          "A square in the heart of Phnom Penh. Walkable distance from grand palace and river front. Neat and clean.",
          "This lotus shape pagoda monument celebrates gaining independence from France. It's in the middle of busy round about where two big streets meet. It's not so close to other major attractions, but you can take a 2$ tuktuk there. Once there walk towards the river, around 30 min",
          "It is located at the very crowded roundabout and very hard to take a nice picture here because of high traffic. you can walk to the statue of King, kingdom of Cambodia, Vietnam Cambodia friendship monument. This monument looks nice at night when it lits",
          "This large memorial is in a very crowded roundabout. It is very photogenic but very hard to obtain a nice picture because of the traffic.",
          "I love running in the area surrounding this monument when in Phnom Penh. Early weekend mornings are best, as there are lots of people doing various workouts. While the monument itself is pretty, I suspect you would eventually get bored if all you did was stare at it every time",
          "Visited here whilst in Phnom Penh, the monument is quite impressive and well worth a visit if you are in the city. It's on a busy roundabout and you can't walk right upto it. It's best done at the start of sights in the city, from here you can walk on a nice area to the statue",
          "Beautifully centred in the middle of massive traffic circle. Nice walk around it with other little monuments etc. Its a nice landmark that you can base your city walks around",
          "This whole area is a great place....wide open boulevards with central park.....this monument looks best at night when lit.",
          "Wasn't a very exciting place to go as a singular structure became a bit repetetive to many other better places we had been in cambodia ( temples in siam reap or the royal palace in Phnom penh it self)",
          "A landmark in the centre of Phnom Penh, particularly at night when floodlit as it dominates the skyline.",
          "I was in this attraction last april 7th 2017 after i visited royal palace and silver pagoda. This area is along highway and you can visit it anytime for free.",
          "This monument looks much better at nights and from a distance, so don't come closer, because it's disappointing. Just pass by, take a picture if you like, but it doesn't deserve a special visit. You'll not lose much if will skip this \"landmark\"",
          "It's ok for taking one photo to mark that you have been to Phnom Penh. It's architecture is interesting. You can read about this from the Internet or guide book.",
          "You're probably going to pass it, and photograph it, but it's not very spectacular - unlike many other nearby buildings",
          "You will pass this place several times while visiting the other attractions in the city.So no need to go especially to see this one. It's a good place to take a walk especially in the evening when the weather is much cooler.",
          "It's a monument. It looks quite pretty at night and is well lit. It's in the center of a busy central traffic intersection. It's clean. It unexceptional, but worth a quick look if you like taking monument pictures at night.",
          "A memorial to Cambodia \ud83c\uddf0\ud83c\udded independence, sited in a well manicured boulevard Lots of night time street venders for snacks and drinks A nice peaceful vibe",
          "This place is like being in the middle of LA in the rush hour. But a heck of a lot more interesting. Be careful crossing the road!!!",
          "No need to stop as it's in the middle of a main roundabout. Just slow the car down and take a picture!!!!",
          "The French presented the monument to make the independence from France in 1958. The monument is in the shape of a lotus-shaped stupa which is based upon a similar design at the Khmer Temple at Angkor Wat and similar Khmer historical sites. We booked a Cyclo ride and passed this",
          "The design of the monument is a classical one but being in th middle of a busy square it is a little difficult to appreciate. Interesting for its historical significance even if more recent history is more prominent.",
          "It`s just a monument, nothing more than that. It stands in the middle of a traffic circle and is next to a walking avenue.",
          "The monument in central Phnom Penh A travel hub Beautiful Khmer style. Beautiful day and night. lol lol",
          "it's pretty but it's nothing you'll specially have to go to. there's not a lot to do around it and you'll surely see it while using a tuktuk anyway.",
          "Phnom Penh city has many people, Phnom Penh city is city of Economic, Phnom Penh city has many come from all around the world, I really like here.",
          "This place just warrants a mere photo stop. To me, it is very average but for those well versed in history, this might make more meaning for you.",
          "That's what is worth for, its meaning. Worth to take a photo with and a must go, but is far from being the most memorable of your trip.",
          "This is a stunning place at night and perfect for photos .. I visited this doing the night Vespa Adventures tour.. this tour is so worth doing.",
          "You really cannot stop here as it is at one of the busiest roads and intersections in the city but it is certaiinly worth asking your driver to drive around it a few times for a video or photo",
          "The monument is best seen lit at night. However you are likely to see it on most evening tuk tuk trips round town. It is surrounded by the usual hectic Phnom Penh traffic",
          "Its a big lump of stone. ot elegent dont waste your time visiting it You can look at it as you go past it on your way to AEON MALL",
          "Beautiful landmark, even glorious at night with good lighting. Best sites for photographers and selfies. I wish they allow us to go inside the monument and see the bone relics they've kept there.",
          "The city centre space is wonderful. The scale is big but not overpowering. These monuments could be better interpreted for western visitors.",
          "It's a nice monument, especially when it is lit up at night. I walked by it in the day while walking to the Royal Palace. I also dropped by one evening by tuk tuk to take a night pic. If you are in town and have time, it makes a nice photo. At the very least, have the tuk tuk",
          "not the most beautiful or stunning monument in Penh that i can consider, but i did happen to see this during sunset on my trip to Penh. It was very beautiful to see the sunset over the monument casting a beautiful background.",
          "Driving through the city at night when we arrived this monument stood out like a beacon. It is beautifully lit at night and is a roundabout for traffic.",
          "A big deal to the locals.. but really just another monument. Drive by..take a quick pic..its part of the town",
          "It's free and it's there and it looks good so if in Pnomh Penh why not visit. The walk along the promenade towards Diamond Island is delightful as well",
          "The independence monument and statue of Sihanouk is in this long park at the center of Phnom Penh. If you will be having your tours here in Phnom penh, I would suggest for you to take the tuktuk. Aside from riding the tuktuk as an experience itself, its also cheap. Its also",
          "This can be seen whilst driving past but if you would like to take photos there is room to stop and do so - can also walk down to the Kings Statue at the same time.",
          "This landmark is by the roundabout before the river. I always see this on my way to Nagaworld Hotel and casino from the airport . Huge enough and unique structure",
          "I have visited phnom penh in a short time because I saw from the reviews that I will not find my interests in this city.independence manument is a famous manument in city center that is a sigh of independence from France.if you are forced to stay in phnom penh it will not bad",
          "It is very, very impressive, so if you are in the area, and you probably will be, make sure you see it close up too..but we wouldn't make a special trip...still worth 5 stars though..",
          "An impressive physical structure stuck in the middle of a roundabout surrounded by busy roads you cant help but spot it if you are travelling around the city. You dont have to make much of an effort to see it.",
          "It is a wonderful place in the Phnom Penh city to spend time in the early morning or evening time. The aesthetic beauty is mentionable & national importance of the monument is very high.",
          "The Independence Monument is centred in a roundabout, but you get a very good view for all sides. Its a nice centre piece to a very large boulevard.",
          "Not much to report here, it's a big monument in a big paved area and has little cultural significance.",
          "Been through here a bit back and forth. Classy, clean and ethnic. This is something I never tire of. Scoured the waterfront several times with a tuk tuk. They alway come down here. I guess they're proud of it. I can see why.",
          "Grand monument at the intersection of grand boulevards. It makes a good reference point. In itself it's nothing to write home about. Pass by in a tuk-tuk.",
          "A hugh Monument built in the centre of a Roundabout with heavy trafic all around, can only snap pictures from the roadside,unless you take a risk n cross the roads to be closer but the trafic police will chase you.....for your safety.Best to take a slow walk, about 40 minutes",
          "Standing in the road as a roundabout it is nevertheless a nice structure. Not large or particularly impressive but OK when passing on the way to S21 or Wat Langa which is on this roundabout.",
          "This monument is quite big but in my opinion nothing too special! In my opinion it is enough when you drive by and have a look at it!",
          "This is an OK sightseeing, important for it's history. If you were close advise you to go there and take some pictures.",
          "Nice for a walk past, lit up at night, nothing too exciting, pass it if you stay local, not much to see, a 5 minute visit, busy street, go by tuk tuk, or walkiing path up the centre pedestrianised area",
          "A kind of phallic symbol on the intersection of a couple main streets in PP but if on foot watch out. No cross walks and aggressive unfriendly drivers and traffic",
          "Well worth seeing as this attractive Monument which dominates the pedestraian area which surrounds it. Recommended.",
          "This sits in quite a nice public space except for being surrounded by large roads and crazy traffic. This is essentially a round about and you will see it when u take a tuk tuk or taxi...dont make a special trip.",

          "The independence monument is kind of in the middle of a round about so actually getting there is very difficult and dangerous. My tuk tuk driver said it's best to see from the road so he drove past it a couple of times so I could get a picture. It's a nice looking monument.",
          "You will certainly drive near this national monument situated on a round about. So if you are a fan of such national monuments, you can get really close.",
          "Quite interesting to look at and observe the craft. Surrounded by a roundabout which means you can take some quite interesting photos depending on what's in the foreground. Only way to ruin it was putting modern red and white crowd control fences around the monument to stop",
          "Can drive past it easy enough and can walk to no problem. Keep. Walking down the river and you'll see it. After years of war it's nice to see",
          "There is a very interesting story about the president at the time and how independence was won. That intrigued me the most. It is sad that so many citizens went through a dark period in the country\u2019s history. But in the end the human spirit triumphed.",

          "my hotel was nearby so I did a run around the park. It looks very amazing and with this beautiful detail on it. It looks better at night because of the light. As some previous review said, its more about the meaning of it rather than the statue itself. so if you just by any",

          "Located in the middle of a traffic circle, barriers impede access to the monument that overlooks the prime minister's residence. You have to brave non-stop traffic in both directions just to get close to it. Nothing to see here.",
          "You'll likely drive past this one anyway. At night it is nicely lit up. The locals don't like what it represents apparently.",
          "It is the history behind it than the monument itself that holds more meaning. Take a few shots of it but that is all. Listen to the story anywhere is sufficient",

          "This is not a tourist attraction itself. It is not more than a monument like small tower?? But you will see this monument so often as it is kind of the centre of Cambodia. It is nice to have a look and get to know where it is for your sense of direction. On special occasions",
          "This is a nice monument that is good to see if you are in Phenom Penh. Chances are likely you will drive by it when you are in town....then you can decide if you want to go back. I liked it during the day to take pics and at night to see the lights. There are some really good",

        "wiki": "The Central Market (Khmer: \u1795\u17d2\u179f\u17b6\u179a\u1792\u17c6\u1790\u17d2\u1798\u17b8, \"Phsar Thom Thmey\", \"New Grand Market\", French: March\u00e9 central de Phnom Penh) is an Art Deco landmark of Phnom Penh, the capital of Cambodia. The bright yellow building completed in 1937 has a 26m high central dome, with four tall arch-roofed arms branching out diagonally across the block, creating vast hallways housing countless stalls and all kinds of goods. Initially designed by city architect Jean Desbois, construction works were supervised by French architect Louis Chauchon.\nWhen it first opened in 1937, it was said to be the biggest market in Asia; today it still operates as a market. \nAfter Phnom Penh became the capital of the French protectorate of Cambodia within French Indochina in 1867, the population grew enormously and the French set about creating a spacious modern city. The decision to build a market dates back to the end of the 1920s in response to the increase in the population to 90,000 inhabitants. It was decided to build it on a marshland in the center of the Chinatown of the time, but the project did not start until 1934 because of the turmoil of the Great Depression. It was designed by Jean Desbois (1891 Cherbourg -1971 Lorient), the architect of the city from 1931-37, and its implementation will be supervised by Louis Chauchon (1875 - 1945 Saigon) and the ingenue Wladimir Kandaouroff. The works are entrusted to the Indochinese Society of Studies and Construction which has already built the markets of Battambang and Cholon. The marsh was drained and work began in August 1935 and was completed in 22 months later; the market was inaugurated by King Sisowath Monivong in September 1937  . \nSince its completion, wet season flooding around the market has remained a problem, a reminder of the marshland it once was.\nThe areas between the four diagonal arms and the surrounding streets were originally planted as gardens; over the years the gardens were gradually filled with various temporary structures, greatly increasing the number of stalls.\nDuring the Franco-Thai war in 1941 the market was bombed by Thai aircraft, causing heavy damage, and it had to be temporarily closed. After the end of World War II it was restored much as it was. \nFrom 2009 to 2011, it underwent a US$4.2 million renovation funded by the French Development Agency. This renovation repaired and restored all the original reinforced concrete structure, and added low arched roofed stall areas in the originally open areas on all four sides.The entrances to the market are lined with souvenir merchants hawking everything from T-shirts and postcards to silver curios and kramas. Inside is a dazzling display of jewels and gold. Electronic goods, stationery, secondhand clothes and flowers are also sold. \n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of markets in Phnom Penh\n\n\n== References ==\n\nCentral Market: Story of a renovation.

          "I found these markets a little lacking. There was some variety but did not have the same as the Russian market. It was a bit chaotic and hard to navigate at times. However, this is just my opinion it's worth a visit for the serious shopper.",

          "Is totally worth a visit! I went there around lunch hour which was great because I had lunch there. It was not cheap I spent 10$ for a coconut and a meal of squid, but the meal was great! There is an area with cloths, other with gadgets, then a area of bras (\ud83d\ude44) and and area",

          "It's almost a little crazy within the Central Market. Good luck I had a local friend to show me around and bring me to the highlights, but there are so many. The best is to follow you instinct and maybe use your compass not to lose your way. You can bargain, but sometimes",

          "Impressive huge market so many stalls with good variety of stock. Was very hot inside when we were there, take a fan.",
          "There\u2019s every kind of up and down market wear available in this mountainous shopping arena, don\u2019t go with the first price as you would have been told. Bargaining is a Cambodian past time and its well worth it.",
          "We visited the market a few times during our holiday. You will find terrific food and juices to eat and drink, as well as heaps of beautiful things to buy for low prices. Just haggle until you got half the price they were asking. Heaps of fun.",
          "We visited Central Market a few times and everyone happy with purchased. Although lot of things were more expensive than last year. There is a huge variety of things to buy especially clothing, jewellery and electronics. Well worth the trip.",
          "It\u2019s a modern building and very airy. Great bargains to be had if you haggle! Typical SE Asian products.",
          "Been there a good place to see the big dome construction, more of Islamic type, it's a place for shopping clothes and cheap electronics, souvenirs, imitation jewelry and lot of short eats around It's a must visit place but the bad thing is they close by 5.30 pm so day time",
          "Everything in multiples and so much bling. If you want a watch, this is the place. Plenty of clothes and bargains to be had. We bought a kimono and several Tin Tin T shirts and some \"Gucci\" sliders.",
          "The central market is probably best known for its jewellery range. Buyer beware however - the US$13 Rolex watch probably won\u2019t work for long! There is also a huge range of clothes, food, electronics, flowers and ornaments. Prices are very reasonable - for example shirts and",
          "Fab clothes and glitter market. Bargain hard for a 30% reduction. Amazing architectural space. French 1935 industrial architecture, restored in 2000.",
          "Great market with everything you dream to buy. Its good to bargen, as it works!!!! I enjoyed it. I bought a big backpack, good quality and giod price. The people want to sell but they are polite and helpful.",
          "You will find shops like these everywhere in Cambodia and Southeast Asia. The building itself is nothing special.",
          "Umpteen small units, each about 1.5 into 1.5 meters in area, selling local produce. It\u2019s my second visit here. It\u2019s safe.",
          "Love this market as the people are not as pushy as Russian market. The fruit juice serve good avocado juice. The food stalls here all too nice. Fresh and1 reasonable price. Try eating noodle and sit at their low and smallish",
          "A neat domed building in the center with plenty of shopping options from the local sellers. If you think the price is too high, just go to the next stall and ask for their price. I got prices anywhere from $12 USD to $2.5 USD for a set of nice chopsticks. It pays to shop",
          "Prefer this market over the Russian market! Had a great selection of gold and silver jewelry among clothes and other souvenirs.",
          "The building by itself is very interesting - big dome with several wings. The central part is filled with jewelry , different gem stones , silver , some gold . On the sides you find clothes , shoes , souvenirs. The quality is not very good to be honest . Don\u2019t forget to bargain",
          "It is a centrally located market with all the usual items like clothes, shoes, artifacts, toys, stuff for kids. Must visit. Bargaining will help. Vendors are polite and welcoming. Lots of tuk tuk outside to go back to hotel. Local food stalls are plenty for non vegetarians. One",
          "Great market with lots on offer. However once you've been to one market you've been to them all... There are lots of people shouting at you trying to get you in their stall but it's all part of the experience",
          "It is a magnificent bargaining place and you can get copy all branded items at very cheap prices. The dome is the biggest for any municipality public place and market. we can spend hours shopping with less prices.",
          "Same as most Asian markets. Building is old and worth a look. You can\u2019t really browse because as soon as you stop they want to know how much you will pay for it, but did feel overly harassed here. Brought a couple of trinkets but still felt that I had got ripped off. This",
          "As a tourist from SE Asia, a market is nothing new to me. So, the only reason I came to visit the Central Market is to admire on the building architecture, which is of course amazing and get some good photos of it. This market sells both wet and dry stuffs, but I am not too",
          "I like vibrant real smelly markets, this one features mostly cheap clothes and cheap jewelry. The central dome is nice, that's about it for me.",
          "The central market is like any other market in South East Asia hot and sticky, however Central market in Phnom Penh is housed in a very nice Art Deco building that is worth a visit just to see that",
          "If you look for things to buy before going back home. It's a good place to go and spend a time. But ensure don't miss to bargain for a better price :-)",
          "If you want a t shirt, they have your size or so they keep telling you! Souvenirs, Shoes, Clothes, Watches etc is the place to go but be warned in extremely warm inside. The fans are a welcome relief but not a lot of them. Inside markets during the day and night markets outside",
          "So much all kind of stuff. There is everything, even meat that has spent all day in the heat and sun. Worth to bargain when you buy.",
          "This market with its big dome is a place for everything. It was pretty crowded with mostly locals. You can get clothes, food stuff, souvenirs and everything else. The guide did not come with us but told us that you can bargain. We had already picked up souvenirs in Siem reap.",
          "This market is busy. Easy to get to via a tuk tuk. Must bargain hard as they start very high. The sellers can be a little pushy but not too bad. The Russian market is better.",
          "We had a stroll through Central Market when we came upon it unexpectedly while 'discovrting' Phnom Penh on foot. Nothing special. Interesting to see the 'dai pai dongs' or cooked food stalls.",
          "This would give you a flavour what a day to day Cambodian\u2019s requirements would be. You can find their staple food, sea food, clothes, accessories and stuff. I did not buy anything here as I was wary about the quality of products there. But just walk through the place to",
          "After dinner, we strolled over to the Central Market (right nearby). Unbelievable how many stalls there were. We got a good buy on some clothes. People were polite and not pushy. Very crowded, and not just with tourists. A must see place - especially the foot massages in",
          "it was good time at central market to know the city life of the Phnom Penh. I will suggest everyone to visit this place at least once in your travel at Phnom Penh.",
          "We went here to find some shoes and found the prices to be set very high for knockoff shoes. We were fine with the knockoff aspect, but several sellers seemed hesitant to budge at all on their prices. The architecture of this place is interesting, and if you shop around, you can",
          "We were famished after the Tamao wildlife rescue park visit in the morning. Reached the market in the afternoon. Not much food choices but we managed to order some fish and noodles. A lot of flies so cannot expect good hygiene. We prefer Russian market than central market. Night",
          "When you go to Central Market be prepared for lots of the same choices with different prices. Lots of interesting smells and food selection. This is an example of how most of the people live. The shops are friendly but push a lot for a sale. It is something of an experience but",
          "It's an experience coming here to shop, I recommend giving it a try! You can find everything from souvenirs, food, clothes, purses, electronics, to motorcycle parts. Plan on bargaining and bring lots of small USD. The are lots of knock off brand items here. If you buy more",
          "What was meant to be a souvenir shopping trip turned out to be a jewelry shopping spree. I couldn't take my eyes off the different colorful stones, rings and earrings wherever I turned. Be careful, though. Make sure you buy from a reputable seller.",
          "The Central Market, a landmark building in the capital, the art-deco Psar Thmei (literally 'New Market') is often called the Central Market, a reference to its location and size. It was built in 1937 and the huge domed hall resembles a Babylonian ziggurat some claim it ranks as",
          "This is a pretty large market which is your typical Asian market. In general the fresh food and meals are sold outside around the outside and goods mainly inside.",
          "Yes, an interesting spot to stop off at and a few interesting sights but nothing extraordinary except possibly the scare stories of pick-pocketing etc. Just take normal care and enjoy the sights, smells and sounds. Does get very busy. Lots of \"genuine fakes\".",
          "This market is super large and with 4 entrances . I stayed in PP for 4 days and went there for 3 times. Some of the shop even provides english menu. If you are backpackers with limited budget, central Market is a good choice. Please be careful of there food conditions with you",
          "Nothing special about this market, lots of clothes and food. Jewelry was in the center. Food stalls included lots of seafood. My wife saw one of our small fury friends running across the aisle so don\u2019t scream if you see one",
          "As the name implies the market is in the centre of Phnom Penh (the main area). It is a large, diverse market with stalls selling all sorts of things. Not necessarily geared toward tourists, I saw a lot of people there, probably expats, buying fresh fruit and vegetables. The",
          "Some stalls accept credit cards. But russian market is a lot more cheaper and affordable. Be sure to lower your price.",
          "This is the main market in Phnom Penh, a modernised version of Asian markets. The clothes & shoes are cheap, the quality reasonable. We bought genuine(?) polarised Ray Ban sunglasses for US$8. When battering start at a third the asking price & stay at this amount until the",
          "Market was very clean and stalls presented well compared to some others we have come across. After you walk past one stand though, they all have the same thing. We went and had a look around but left empty handed. There were quite a bit of stalls but not as much variety as",
          "I made a quick visit there during the low tourist season and it was fairly quiet so easy to navigate through the market. The prices were quite reasonable and there was a wide variety of clothing and jewelry available. Overall a nice place to visit.",
          "There are numerous shops selling fake brands but in the centre is a lady selling glasses/sunglasses. Ask for \"Theary\". She is on the West side. If you bring your prescription with she gets it made at about half the price we in the west (Australia). They come with a script",
          "I like Russian market more. Although central market is more organized than Russian market but most shops sell the same thing!",
          "Quite a big market with many different kinds of shops - very 'local styled ' closes , shoes , hair salons , etc.",
          "The market is huge. It has practically anything and everything in there. There were jewellery, clothes, shoes, bags, homeware, kitchen equipment, food- dry and wet market, eateries, hairdressing and beauty services. I got a manicure in there, and my nails look great! Well",
          "We visited here on our last day to find some bits to take home, bought a coupleof Cambodian style BBQ pans as they have a great kitchenwares/utility section. Also has clothes, jewellery, watches, electronics and some small souveniers. We bought a couple of lovely paintings here",
          "The market comprises both wet and dry area, selling a wide range of items from clothings, accessories, neccessities to local food (fresh/cooked) etc. You can also try haggling the price with the stall holders if you wanted to purchase any of their items.",
          "We loved the Central Market. It was really interesting, great value for money and the architecture was truly something to see. Fantastic we thought.",
          "All stall holders are open to bargaining. The range of goods for sale is huge. In addition it is perfect place to try local food. Usually gets very hot inside the hall.",
          "Even the sellers were oppressed by the heat and humidity during our visit, many laying on the stall floor under a fan. I purchased some pirate ear phones for a good price, yet to see how they perform.",
          "Awesome market, selling everything you ever wanted. It is so much improved from when I was here first, more than 20 years ago. It is a nice respite from the hot sun outside too. Best market in Phnom Pehn and wonderful building too. Always worth a visit when you are in the city.",
          "If you want to buy cheap souvenirs to bring home, this is the place to go. For example : a fridge magnet costs about USD$2-3 in the Central Market & a pack of 6 key chains also for the same price. But if you buy from the airport duty free shop, it would cost USD$2 for just 1",
          "This is a day time market and different from the others. The jewellery available is stunning and the electronics on offer are all a great price. There is tourist police available outside, should you have any problems. A safe and nice experience",
          "Visited as part of a tour group. Huge area, so have a meeting point !!!.Different to a market in UK, odd to see ladies having pedicure & manicure.....hair coloured etc....loads to buy, fashion, jewellery, flowers, paintings, lunch stalls.....the list was endless. All very",
          "Interesting market with great architecture. Its quite large and well laid out. Prices are not as cheap as other countries in South East Asia but its still a lot of fun and there is plenty of opportunity to get souvenirs or clothes.....If you want it, its here!",
          "Well worth a wander through here for just about everything. You can have items made to measure here, nails done, hair done, a one stop shop! When shopping barter hard.",
          "This market has spectacular architecture with a cool inner dome and radiating arms filled with all kinds of market goodies from clothes to fresh produce, and everything in between. The jewelery part is huge and not seen so much in other markets. Bargain kindly; it must be so",
          "It's a pretty cool marketplace and a lot of it is in the shade or has canvas over it or is inside of a building. It's really fun shopping but I think prices are better at the night market fairly close by. for example a stick of barbecued shrimp they were trying to sell us for",
          "I personally wasn\u2019t keen on this market, I felt hassled and uncomfortable it\u2019s more a market for the locals especially the food area, I found daunting with some smells I would\u2019ve rather not smelt. But there you go your in Cambodia so you have to embrace it and go for the",
          "There are certain things at Central market (in Khmer they called it \"New market\") that are really great to buy. If you're looking for a watch or audio electronic equipment (ex. Earphones), this is a great place to go. Tons of options and selection. There are a variety of",
          "On our annual trips to Phnom Penh we usually visit this market several times. It\u2019s centrally located and easily accessed from its well planned entrances. We ask our Tuk Tuk driver to drop us off at an entrance, recognised by a nearby landmark, (a building or sign) and set a time",
          "You have to visit Central Market when in Phnom Penh but go early in the morning as it can get really hot and stuffy. There are lots of aisles of clothes, shoes, toys, electronics etc mostly copies and souvenirs if you like that sort of thing this is the place and at good prices.",
          "This place is very easy to get to in Phnom Penh and should be a must stop for anyone who wants to have some kind of keepsake after they've visited Cambodia. The shape of the building is most unique too. It's almost like a cut in half beehive dome shaped top, (and light yellow in",
          "If you have forgotten to bring something on you're travels you can get a replacement here. You can get everything you need (and a lot that you don't need but want, here) very cheaply, Clothes, electricals, jewellery, watches, bags, shoes, food and a lot more besides.",
          "Great markets under cover but if you like the challenge of haggling and finding anything copy/fake and it being workable is a challenge. Runners are a bargain but sizing is questionable, also double check sizing before you leave the markets.",
          "It was hot hot in the noon as I was visiting there but it is a nice place for all the items you would want to buy--from kramas to handicrafts and readymade t-shirts and so on...so many shops and people to see around. enjoyed it.",
          "Plenty to choose from souvenirs to clothes. Still I find it a little bit overprices. If you do both Phnom Penh and Siem Reap, just do your shopping in SR as I find things a little bit expensive in PP.",
          "Good Place, nice play area for kids and food places. Near to central market which is famous for low price shopping",
          "Went to the Russian Markets yesterday, power was out and there were a lot of the same stalls in a confined space. Central Markets is huge in comparison though a lot easier to get lost and loop back through the same passages. Lots of opportunities to negotiate price or walk away",
          "Not the best market be prepared to bargain as there start prices are3 an 4 times over what it\u2019s worth .",
          "Spent a few hours wandering the market for local treasures. Lovely people and also quite fun bargaining for items.",
          "It\u2019s a market with history. The traders weren\u2019t pushy and there is plenty to buy. We went for the atmosphere and it was an interesting experience. If you don\u2019t like markets then don\u2019t go. But the buildings itself is interesting to look at.",
          "Visited this place on my first day in Phnom Penh and was amazed with the items theyre selling! Even bought some souveniers for my fam and friends!",
          "I have been to a few large markets in South East Asia so knew what they are like. This is no exception. Clothes everywhere, food everywhere. I particularly liked the flower section. Looked great smelt even better",
          "This market is a must visit. They sell quality merchandise at very good prices. They have a variety of items and wonderful souvenirs for family and friends",
          "Almost everything selling here such as souveniers , clothes, t-shirt, watch, cameras and gadgets, food and drinks.",
          "It is big local marakets where locals sell everything for both locals and tourists. We didnt end up buying anything, but it was good to look around... Alot of fruits and fresh flowers too !",
          "Visited in early April, wonderful variety of local crafts and clothing. Great displays of local fruit, vegetables and meat and fish on display. Nice to walk through a market and not be hassled by the stall owners to buy something as is the case in Thai land or Bali. Very",

          "Amazing hub of colour,people,lifestyles. worth a visit. I went twice, once with a complete stranger ( another story !) & second, with my camera",
          "Loved this place. You do get turned around with some many entrances and exits. You can buy just about anything you can think of from fried tarantulas to shampoo to clothing to jewelry. What a fun tourist experience",
          "Lot of local shop , with variety of goods : cloths , food , jewelry etc . Do not hesitate to bargain on price",
          "The central market is a place to shop for souvenirs and cheap eats. You can find local food and exotic insects at the market. Make sure you bargain when it comes to shopping for clothes and souvenirs! Stall owner usually mark up the price. There are paid public toilets in",
          "I\u2019d visited The Central Market on a weekday at around 4pm plus. It was not crowded at that time probably as it was near their closing time. Good place to scout for T shirts, children\u2019s clothes. It was not as stuffy inside the market compared to the Russian Market. Quite an",
          "I was here 6 years ago and went straight back when we arrived.Depending what you are after it could be a complete waste of time but I was after mens and womens clothing.Lots and lots of stalls going off in different directions .Kitchenware was good too.Tourist items slightly",
          "We stayed nearby so were able to walk there. Definitely worth a visit, lots to see and prices were reasonable. Take note of where you enter as it all looks much the same once inside. Carry USD for purchases. We visited later in the day, it was not crowded and quite relaxing to",
          "Okay, so unless you have a plan to buy something specific it's the same as any major market in any Asian city. Worth a look if you have time to kill, but after 10 min in 40+ Deg heat and over 80% humidity we had had enough",
          "We visited this market today and it is huge! We were not looking for anything in particular but there is pretty much everything you would expect from a Asian market I found the walk through the food market fascinating. The building itself is worth seeing. A word of advice though",
          "A place where copies of brands are sold! Expensive for rubbish quality spare your trip to there unless you are going to spend your money on rubbish A few roads away you can but cloths for half the price the rest you don't want to buy nor bring home",
          "First of all, the building is beautiful and adds a character to the city. The market is fairly clean but it is absolutely huge and can get very crowded. As it is with other markets, the vendors all sell similar things, foods, services. Good place to drop by.",
          "Good place to go if you want a bargain but once you have been to one you have seen them all. As it\u2019s indoor it can get very hot, go first thing in the morning.",
          "The building is a French colonial structure with a distinctive look. Inside is filled with stores/stalls filled with clothes, jewelry, and the usual souvenirs. Nothing you couldn\u2019t find anywhere else.",
          "LOCATION We stayed at the \u201cLe grand palais boutique\u201d hotel (see my review) which is 2 blocks away. The bus station is also nearby, as we returned on an overnight bus from Siem Reap arriving about 06:00 am and walked to find breakfast nearby. CENTRAL DOME Despite the opening",
          "This is a must see attraction with something for everyone and I always buy local handicrafts here each trip for friends at home",
          "The exterior is just small shops, somewhat categorized for what you are looking for to a point. But most items you can find at regular street vendors and small shops throughout. Most merchants are outdoors with makeshift covering leading to the main building. The building",
          "I found this market to be much cheaper than the \u201cRussian market\u201d and had a much more varied goods on sale, stall holders would have a good haggle which I find, strangely this year, not in the Russian market. Very clean also.",
          "It was crazy hot and packed with people when my husband and I visited the market at 1400 on a Saturday afternoon. We probably saw about half of what the market had to offer in the hour we spent there before the heat defeated us... We managed to snap up a couple of bargains (in",
          "I don\u2019t handled harassment well and while interesting to observe and I\u2019m sure there are bargains galore to find the stench from the wet market area is best avoided. The flowers are beautiful and there is choice galore when it comes to jewellery, silver ware, clothing and bags",
          "Excellent market which caters to all your shopping needs. It's indoors so gets you out of the sun and has everything from jewelry to clothes to food. I brought tons of stuff here, a must see if you, like me, like to buy gifts for family and friends.",
          "If you are planning to visit Phnom penh, and looking to buy loads of cambodian Souvenirs, this is the place!! Don't go anywhere else, or buy from any other place. Prices are best, mind boggling!!",
          "To be honest it was a bit of a waste of time nothing different to any market you would find anywhere in Asia Not to sure what I was looking for I suppose I was looking for something to excite me It\u2019s very hot and humid Mike",
          "Central Market is one place where we can get a lot of local Silks, handicrafts, souvenirs etc. However, one should bargain to get a good deal.",
          "Even if you don\u2019t want to buy anything, spend an hour or two in this market with something for everybody. The prices may differ from salesperson to salesperson. Walk around and barter before you start shopping. If you feel something is too expensive, go to the next \u201cshop\u201d. But",
          "Very close to my hotel on 136 street. The building is beautiful. The inside is like a Warren with rows of stalls coming of from the central area.. suppose it's like being inside an octopus. Like most Asian markets the stalls are selling clothes and trinkets with the ones under",
          "The only reason a visitor should see this place is if she\u2019s interested in architecture. But this will take all of five minutes, as you take in the interesting dome from the interior of this market space. In terms of a shopping trip I wouldn\u2019t bother, unless you\u2019re some kind of",
          "The central market is covered, cleaner and easier to navigate than some of the markets visited in other Cambodian cities.",
          "Good place to grab some Cambodian souvenirs to bring home.Bargaining is a must but prices are more reasonable unlike in some countries like Egypt where prices are inflated unreasonably high.Pay what you think the item is worth.Lots of counterfeit things which I don't have much",
          "Very hot and crowded. If you don\u2019t like crowds and being approached, this is not the place for you. It is fascinating watching the locals and stall holders. Don\u2019t forget to haggle!",
          "The French-built building is huge and designed to let air flow through. So many stalls to see, both for tourists and locals. Well worth a visit",
          "A huge market, open everyday, with everything you could ever want or need....IF you can find it! One of the cooler markets in Phnom Penh, well worth a visit, be prepared to haggle & probably get lost!",
          "Great place for shopping, better price comparing to Russian Market and other shopping mall. Lots of selection of items , very organise venue.",
          "CM is a popular and by Asian standards unhassled market. You can find everything here from buddha statues to gold, from the rip-off T shirts to food markets. The building is interesting and it really worth the visit but beware it gets hot....",
          "My wife and I came to the market to look for some souvenirs from our Cambodia trip and found what we were looking for.The Central market is huge and filled with everything you could imagine,we spent hours wandering around and unlike some of the other markets the sellers weren't",
          "Great variety, you can buy everything. Take some cash im sure you will buy something. Well worth a morning visit",
          "Much less touristy than Russian market the local food section is interesting, although hygiene may not be up to western standards, and the seafood section of the market is amazing, lots of love seafood being sold , the Asian equivalent of Barcelona's famous markets. it's a",
          "They have a little bit of everything, flowers, clothes, shoes, trinkets, food, produce. They will bargain but just about 20 percent. The quality is not that great but it is good for souviners.",
          "This was described as a must do, but we didn't think it was great. The good part is nice to see - very colourful fruit and veg, but the main central part was just fake tat and not really of interest to us.",
          "Good place to pick up alsorts of clothes and luggage the vendors are happy to haggle and don't seem as stressed as some",
          "Huge market with multiple arms from a central location. Jewellery, clothes, seafood, meat, fruit and veggies, this market has it all.",
          "You get everything you are looking for at the central market. Try it! It is fun, though I never knew, where I entered or left the building, cause it is really huge. Prices depend on what you need, of course, but mostly you can deal out a good price. I loved it!",
          "This is a crazy busy place where tons of knock off designer bags,clothes and scarfs can be found. One great bargain are packs of 100-real notes (worth 2-1/2 each) which is crisp and new and great handouts to family and friends when you return home.",
          "Every thing you can think of; traditional scarves, packets of nuts, fresh produce, modern clothing, souvenirs of all kinds....and for a bargain too. Don't hesitate to bargain with vendors and if you don't get the price you want, try another stall because you might get the exact",
          "The cramped closeness of overstocked stalls, the smells of cooking, the crowds... all make this type of market somewhere which is difficult not to explore. A long line of Monks receiving alms of food all adds to the interest. The Memsahib loves it .",
          "bargain and you will get very good pricing. start from half of what they quote or may be even lesser if you are brave enough. the ladies dont get angry but will bargain with you making sure you buy from them. the ladies are always smiling and are always ready to help you out",
          "There is a lot of everything everywhere crammed into such small area. Everything is usually made by a family member even though multiple stalls sell the same items. Take your time to look around before bartering for a better deal. The outside has lots of different foods with",
          "Everything you would expect at a Thai, Vietnam, Cambodian market. Fresh produce, meat and vegetables, clothes, souvenirs, junk and everything else usually Very inexpensive",
          "Large impressive structure but full of tat. All stalls the same. Don't go near the meat and fish area if you have anything like a weak stomach.",
          "The Central Market was not as overwhelming as the Russian Market, which was larger and more crowded. There were many stalls outside the main building. The stalls contained a mix of trinkets, clothes, jewelry, everyday housewares, and food items. Be prepared to haggle for your",
          "Completed in 1937, Phsar Thmei was said to be the largest market in all of Asia at its time of construction. Under the large Art Deco dome, you\u2019ll find dozens of merchants selling jewelry and watches, while the wings are reserved for electronic equipment, household goods,",
          "It\u2019s a slightly disappointing market when you compare it to the likes of Thailand, Laos and Vietnam but it has some good bargains and stalls. Unfortunately not that much variation in the items for sale - it\u2019s all kind of similar from stall to stall. Impressive building though.",
          "This is the place to bargain to your hearts content. Whatever price they offer you, cut the price in half and go a little lower than that half cut price. So if they say $6, you offer $2. Walk away and they will call you back to sell it to you for $2. Your minimum buying price",
          "Phnom Pehn in general is the most expensive place in Cambodia, add to that the crowds, smog and low standard of local food and you may want to consider flying into Siem Reap.",

          "From all the reviews we were expecting this to be a bustling market with many items on offer. Maybe our timing was off as there wasn't much at all and we were done in less than 15 minutes. The only markets selling goods was on the outer rim.",
          "It's a kind of place where you can spend an hour or so buying souvenirs for family and friends. Most of the stuff here is of very poor quality so if you are buying t-shirts or other garments, do not expect them to last long. Also, you will need to do a LOT OF BARGAINING here.",
          "Like other markets in Asia,a mix with wet markets,food stalls and clothes,daily necessities...etc. Always nice to visit the market and get a vibe of how local lives and eat.",
          "What a chaos and so much stuff: clothes, jewelry, underwear, food, flowers, electronics, household supplies. You name it and it\u2019s here. Would recommend to keep a close eye at your bag. There are atm\u2019s, toilets and you can eat (if you have a strong stomach) and drink.",
          "No matter how much it is, but don\u2019t forget to bargain the price. It could 20 to 30% down from original price. The items for souvenirs from Cambodia.",
          "Not as big as russian market - fewer stalls for souvenirs. Try the food stalls. Bought banana crackers, dried mangoes and kapot pepper here. Liked the Red pepper seeds compared to the black or white seeds. Really expensive at airport. Quite a few shoes stalls. Almost bought a",
          "Visited this market last-minute for some souvenirs to take home. We found the usual market-y treasures: coconut bowls, tshirts, coin purses, paintings, wallets etc. There were also stalls selling little wooden statues and silver jewelry and plates etc but these weren't cheap. A",

          "The central market in Phnom Penh wasn\u2019t busy when we went there, but it can get pretty busy at times. The place has all kinds of nick nacks, bits and bobs. It isn\u2019t particularly an interesting place, but the flower market is pretty beautiful. Here you can see women putting",
          "central market in the central of phnom penh, in fact this market is common market for tourist, organised very well, we can find all cambodian souvenier, local food, local fruits and everything but the price is slightly high, maybe most of visitor in central market are tourist",

          "The market has a large jewellery section in the middle,and it has sections with different types of clothing. Outside tends to be cheaper for similar things, but be prepared to haggle, or get ripped off. There are many types of street food stalls,that sell all manner of tasty",

          "Good for trinkets and souvenires, any clothes or footwear will be for smaller sizes it is still a local market, gems and gold inside but me personally would never buy such in a market",
          "We spoke to some locals before going here and they said - you will be charged double of what everything is worth so whatever they say cut in half. If they say no then say ok and walk off. They will soon come back to you with a reasonable price. Lots of everything can be bought",
          "Friday 11th January and we paid a visit to this large market which is housed in a unique Art Deco building which is a landmark in Phnom Penh. The dome shaped building has four arms branching out from it, from the outside it sort of resembles a train station. Inside the dome",

          "I have always enjoyed shopping at the central market This trip the vendors were really hungry and willing to deal and discount on anything and everything. If you need something don\u2019t go to the big mall!!!! central market is the best place to go for the best prices.",
          "Enclosed market carrying all the usual trinkets sold on street corners and markets throughout the country. Have fun as you walk through and barter.",
          "Nothing special to see...fake and cheap things and souvenir and rush, rush, rush...around market is very dirty.",

          "Somewhere that the less fortunate can make a living from the more fortunate. Don't be afraid. Find a concrete bench and drink in the way that things are done here. Be warned that the food area is very smelly Gold area is overpriced and the clothing area has many copies.",

          "Nice shopping place. Sell a kind of stuffs mainly non-authentic if u looking at international label. Please make sure u bargain.. usually can go avg 30% lower. There is a local eatery there selling local food. Good food but hygiene wise.. u decide..",

          "It is worth going here just to see the structure itself as it is quite amazing. You can find almost everything in this market and the surrounding area. You can find some wonderful coffee shops around here and they know how to make a good coffee in this town.",
          "It's worth a visit. Good prices on merchandise. Didn't stay too long but did end up buying a bracelet for a good price.",
          "We had a nice coffee at a place on the corner of the market called 53rd on central. We\u2019d been to the Russian Market first which is a tad more authentic and also cheaper than the central market but the decor and architecture of the Central market makes it more interesting",
          "It is always good to visit the Central Market. There is always a lot of lively activity in and around the fabulous mustard-coloured 1930s French construction. There were bargains to be had and interesting people to meet.",
          "Same old crap for sale, just more of it in one place. I think the Russian Market is better. The building is nice to wander through, but you will find nothing here you haven\u2019t seen before. Better t-shirts in Siem Reap.",
          "We visited this market and found things to be reasonably priced if you after haggling. Generally, we got 50% off the asking price. Lots of jewellery, T-shirts, shoes, electronic goods and food. The building was nice and the location was not too crowded.",
          "Same goods as any other market in the area but the architecture is interesting. We didn't buy anything there but if you want something they will have it.",
          "OK if you need to get something for your trip. There was a good variety of items such as fresh fish, fruit and veg, daily essentials such as toilet paper and jewellery. I saw more tourists than locals when I went.",
          "Good place to strike a nice deal, it can get a bit crowd inside, the mid area are a lot of the same stuff, like most of the markets in Cambodia. The fresh food area were nice and clean.",
          "We got a few bargains from here. Very nice market with a variety of clothes glasses to buy. Clean toilets and a lot of tuk tuks outside of you get tired of walking. Definitely worth a visit",
          "Well worth a visit. Prices same as around town, some traders will however discount for more than one item.",
          "Interesting place for wide varieties of shops though most of them sell quite similar products...however, be wary of certain stalls which sell fruits and food stuffs, they seemed to have two prices for their goods, one for foreigners and one for local ! If you sense they are",
          "Try to bargain as much as possible because they will set a very high price for foreigners. It\u2019s not a good behavior of the sellers.",

          "Visited the central market to have a look around mainly as a attraction point and nothing in mind in particular to purchase. Lot of shops for watches, ornaments, wooden and silver articles, dresses, bags, electronics, mobiles, etc etc are located on different wings, in the",
          "We had a blast wandering and sampling! See the real Phnom Penh. The people are friendly and very polite!",
          "Absolutely huge market in the heart of Phnom Penh- hundreds of stalls selling everything from clothing to fish. You can find a knock-off of just about anything here if you look hard enough. The overall experience can be quite overwhelming- it's crowded and there's a lot going",
          "Very interesting place. Buzz of activity. Found prices to be very high here. So go here after you get a sense of what things cost. Or I think you will be ripped off...Cambodians are lovely people but they will overcharge you. Night markets are better",
          "Interesting market to visit and kill some spare time. They sell almost anything inside. The flower part was very nice.",
          "So many stalls and vendors, you can get so lost in here. Don't lose track of any travelling companions, you may never see them again. :)",
          "Central market was interesting and is worth a visit. Big undercover market in an interesting building. Had a central clock and the stalls are varied and fun. Stall owners are open to negotiation (they start at very high prices, but come to a reasonable price) and are generally",
          "I don\u2019t know the excitement really about visiting Central Market except that\u2019s it\u2019s in the middle of the city close to everything. You can get good prices on food and clothing etc. But new state of the art malls are opening around town, and Central Market feels stuck in the",

          "The central market is a bustling place where you can find all range of things. Be aware it can be very hot as you wander around and quite crowded. The central dome area filled with 100,s of stalls is impressive.",
          "Central market or Psar Thmei was built in 1937 and is a beautiful art deco dome with four \"arms\" branching out. The impact inside is of a huge, light filled space. An outdoor market surrounds the building (mainly clothes, fresh vegetables and fruit) whilst indoors there are",
          "Plenty of choices of local products in this market. Especially live seafood was very good with reasonable price",
          "I spent several days wandering around looking, haggling and doing deals. At the market everyone has enough grasp of English to be able to communicate with. You have to Bargain, once you get the hang of it its fun. plenty of variety and a lot of the same, something for everyone",
          "Lots and lots of clothes and jewelry. Not a lot of souvenirs. Interesting to see food market in the building. If you want souvenirs, go to the Russian market - much more fun and better selection.",
          "I realize that all stall holders are trying to make a living, but we have been to many markets on our trip to Cambodia, and both my wife and I remarked that the stall owners here were remarkably unfriendly - in stark contrast to the Russian Market, where we were earlier in the",
          "If you\u2019ve been to other markets in Cambodia, this is probably the most expensive. It seems kinda big, but it\u2019s not impressive.

          "Central market is easy to get to by tuk-tuk. once there it is big. you can get anything from motorcycle tyres to seafood. the food section is scary by western health standards but quite interesting. the sellers are not pushy like in Bali or Malaysia.",
          "Wow these markets are one of the best I have ever been to. Lots of everything and great prices. If you bargain and they let you walk away you are to low. Usually go about half n see what happens. Some will give you sad faces but just a put on. Just awesome to walk around.",
          "Iconic architecture. Shirts, souvenirs, electrical goods, gems & silver are available. If you are planning to buy silver, do ensure you do your homework. Outside the market, plenty of shops and restaurants as well. Suggest to spend couple of hours if you are planning to buy",

          "As far as markets go, compared to the size of the market, there was a surprising lack of goods on sale. If you have the chance to visit other large markets in Southeast Asia, give this a pass.",
          "The central market is a very big and busy place that sells everything you can think of: jewellery, house hold, flowers, food (fresh and cooked), ornaments, clothes, shoes and \"branded\" items. You can choose to donate in the charity box at the entrance (a lot of people had put",
          "Very large and extensive indoor market with items ranging from jewelry to T-shirts but I found the most interesting parts to be housewares, foods, and observing the seamstresses and hairdressers. And the florists displays are amazing. Certainly worth a look but don\u2019t go planning",
          "It's a pretty large complex with shops inside and outside selling similar things. Definitely haggle if you can. I found that they definitely sell a lot of stuff at least 50% cheaper than what I saw in duty free. Basically a place to purchase all your souvenir needs.",

          "We were impressed with this market, providing more space and variety of goods than most markets we have seen. We particularly enjoyed the food market displaying a wide variety of fruits and seafood amongst other things. Well worth a visit if you enjoy shopping and bargaining.",
          "A big market selling comprehensive items. Clothings, household, IT stuff, jewelleries, watches, food, fruits.. and many more. Prices in Phnom Penh is more generally higher than Siem Reap. So you need to do some bargaining. The sellers are not pushy, which makes shopping there a",
          "Wandered through the Central market as part of a day plan during my stay in Phnom Penh. Not the nicest or most exciting market I have visited in Southeast Asia but still worth a visit. Fairly fun to walk through the produce/food section to see the fresh catch of the day and grab",

          "Our family of four (two teenagers) enjoyed this market. Similar to other markets we\u2019ve visited in SE Asia. More interesting than the Russian Market, little hassling and generally nice vendors. We found some amazing soup at a stall for a bargain and some delicious smoothies. Easy",
          "If you like markets, this is for you. The central market is quite large and spills from its dome out. There is everything you could imagine, from food, to electronics, clothing and jewelry.",

          "We loved this market. But its is so busy and kind of stressful (they are fairly aggressive), so I would give myself a day or so to get a bit familiar with Phnom Phen before I would go there. Make sure you know what you are buying and if possible a street price of theses goods",
          "Not at all what we expected, underwhelmed big time. Clothes are a no no here, you're better off shopping for clothes in Bangkok. The exact same ladies top that can be had for 100 baht at Platinum Mall in BKK was at US$ 10 asking price here. Ladies pants that would go for 250-300",

However, there are much better markets in Asia and people can be funny with you if you don\u2019t buy certain things. Dress in",

It is the best-known of the sites known as The Killing Fields, where the Khmer Rouge regime executed over one million people between 1975 and 1979.\n\n\n== Description ==\nMass graves containing 8,895 bodies were discovered at Choeung Ek after the fall of the Khmer Rouge regime. Many of the dead were former political prisoners who were kept by the Khmer Rouge in their Tuol Sleng detention center and in other Cambodian detention centers.\nToday, Choeung Ek is a memorial, marked by a Buddhist stupa. The stupa has acrylic glass sides and is filled with more than 5,000 human skulls. Some of the lower levels are opened during the day so that the skulls can be seen directly. Many have been shattered or smashed in.\nTourists are encouraged by the Cambodian government to visit Choeung Ek. Apart from the stupa, there are pits from which the bodies were exhumed. Human bones still litter the site.\nOn May 3, 2005, the Municipality of Phnom Penh announced that they had entered into a 30-year agreement with JC Royal Co. to develop the memorial at Choeung Ek.  As part of the agreement, they are not to disturb the remains still present in the field.\n\n\n== In popular culture ==\nThe film The Killing Fields is a dramatised portrayal of events like those that took place at Choeung Ek.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n Media related to Choeung Ek at Wikimedia Commons",

Allow at least 2 hours for the audio guide and walk.",

        "wiki": "The Fall of Phnom Penh was the capture of Phnom Penh, the capital of the Khmer Republic, by the Khmer Rouge on 17 April 1975, effectively ending the Cambodian Civil War. At the beginning of April 1975, Phnom Penh, one of the last remaining strongholds of the Khmer Republic, was surrounded by the Khmer Rouge and totally dependent on aerial resupply through Pochentong Airport. With a Khmer Rouge victory imminent, the US government evacuated US nationals and allied Cambodians on 12 April 1975. On 17 April the Khmer Republic government evacuated the city, intending to establish a new government center close to the Thai border to continue resistance. Later that day the last defences around Phnom Penh were overrun, and the Khmer Rouge occupied Phnom Penh.\nCaptured Khmer Republic forces were taken to the Olympic Stadium where they were executed, while senior government and military leaders were forced to write confessions prior to their executions. The Khmer Rouge ordered the evacuation of Phnom Penh, emptying the city except for expatriates who took refuge in the French Embassy until 30 April when they were transported to Thailand.\n\n\n== Background ==\nAt the beginning of 1975 the Khmer Republic, a United States-supported military government, controlled only the Phnom Penh area and a string of towns along the Mekong River that provided the crucial supply route for food and munitions coming upriver from South Vietnam. As part of their 1975 dry season offensive, rather than renewing their frontal attacks on Phnom Penh, the Khmer Rouge set out to cut the crucial Mekong supply route. On 12 January 1975 the Khmer Rouge attacked Neak Luong, a key Khmer National Armed Forces (FANK) defensive outpost on the Mekong. On 27 January, seven vessels limped into Phnom Penh, the survivors of a 16-ship convoy that had come under attack during the 100 kilometres (62 mi) journey from the South Vietnamese border. On 3 February a convoy heading downriver hit naval mines laid by the Khmer Rouge at Ph\u00fa M\u1ef9, approximately 74 kilometres (46 mi) from Phnom Penh. The Khmer National Navy (MNK) had mine-sweeping capability, but due to the Khmer Rouge control of the riverbanks mine-sweeping was impossible or, at best, extremely costly. The MNK had lost a quarter of its ships, and 70 percent of its sailors had been killed or wounded.By 17 February, the Khmer Republic abandoned attempts to reopen the Mekong supply line; all subsequent supplies for Phnom Penh would have to come in by air to Pochentong Airport. The United States quickly mobilised an airlift of food, fuel and ammunition into Phnom Penh, but as US support for the Khmer Republic was limited by the Case\u2013Church Amendment, BirdAir, a company under contract to the US Government, controlled the airlift with a mixed fleet of C-130 and DC-8 planes, flying 20 times a day into Pochentong from U-Tapao Royal Thai Navy Airfield.On 5 March, Khmer Rouge artillery at Toul Leap (11.574\u00b0N 104.757\u00b0E\ufeff / 11.574; 104.757), north-west of Phnom Penh, shelled Pochentong Airport, but FANK troops recaptured Toul Leap on 15 March and ended the shelling. Khmer Rouge forces continued to close in to the north and west of the city and were soon able to fire on Pochentong again. On 22 March rockets hit two supply aircraft, forcing the US Embassy to announce on 23 March a suspension of the airlift until the security situation improved. The Embassy, realizing that the Khmer Republic would soon collapse without supplies, reversed the suspension on 24 March and increased the number of aircraft available for the airlift. The hope among the Khmer Government and the Embassy was that the Khmer Rouge offensive could be held back until the start of the rainy season in May when fighting typically abated.\n\n\n== Offensive ==\n\n\n=== Late March ===\nBy late March the FANK maintained a defensive perimeter some 15 kilometres (9.3 mi) from central Phnom Penh. In the northwest, the 7th Division was in an increasingly difficult position, its front had been cut in several places, particularly in the region of Toul Leap which had changed hands several times. The 3rd Division, located on Route 4 in the vicinity of Bek Chan (11.51\u00b0N 104.748\u00b0E\ufeff / 11.51; 104.748), some 10 kilometres (6.2 mi) west of Pochentong was cut off from its own command post at Kompong Speu.In the south, the 1st Division handled the defense, along with the 15th Brigade of Brigadier General Lon Non; it was the calmest part of the front at that time. In the region of Takhmau, Route 1 and the Bassac River, the 1st Division was subject to continued Khmer Rouge pressure. East of the capital were the Parachute Brigade and the troops of the Phnom Penh Military Region. The MNK naval base on the Chrouy Changvar peninsula (11.583\u00b0N 104.916\u00b0E\ufeff / 11.583; 104.916) and the Khmer Air Force (KAF) base at Pochentong were defended by their own forces. The key position of Neak Luong on the east bank of the Mekong was completely isolated. The KAF and the MNK were overstretched and undersupplied and could not satisfy the demands of the FANK. The general logistic situation for FANK was increasingly critical and the resupply of ammunition for the infantry could only be carried out sporadically.\n\n\n=== 1 April ===\nPremier Lon Nol resigned on 1 April. The departure ceremony at the Chamcar Mon Palace was attended by Khmer only, the diplomatic corps having not been invited. From the grounds of Chamcar Mon, helicopters took Lon Nol, his family and party to Pochentong, where Lon Nol met US Ambassador John Gunther Dean before boarding an Air Cambodge flight to U-Tapao in Thailand and into exile. Saukam Khoy became acting President and it was hoped that with Lon Nol's departure peace negotiations could progress.The rapidly worsening situation of March was capped on the night of 1 April by the fall of Neak Luong, despite ferocious resistance and following a three-month siege. This development opened the southern approach to the capital and freed up 6000 Khmer Rouge soldiers to join the forces besieging Phnom Penh. The capture of six 105-mm howitzers at Neak Luong was a further menace to the capital.\n\n\n=== 2\u201311 April ===\nFrom 3\u20134 April all FANK positions on Route 1 above Neak Luong held by the FANK 1st Division fell one after the other, any reinforcement, whether by road or by the Mekong, was impossible. North of the capital, in the 7th Division area, Khmer Rouge attacks came daily and despite regular air support, there was no improvement in the situation there. Several counterattacks by FANK, carried out to retake lost positions, were unsuccessful. The losses suffered by the 1st Division grew each day and the evacuation of its sick and wounded by helicopter was no longer possible. The last reserves of the high command, constituted by hastily taking the battalions of the former Provincial Guard, were rushed to the north, only to be completely dispersed by the Khmer Rouge after several hours of combat. A great breach was opened in the northern defenses; there was not hope of closing it. To the west, the troops of Brigadier General Chantaraingsei's 3rd Division, despite reinforcements, were unable to join with their own elements at Kompong Speu and to retake the position at Toul Leap. A computation error which caused FANK artillery fire to land on 3rd Division elements during this operation had a bad effect on the unit's morale.Throughout this period civilian refugees fled toward the capital from all directions. The authorities, both civil and military, were swamped and no one knew where to lodge them. Schools, pagodas and public gardens were occupied by these refugees and there was no way for the authorities to determine who was friend and who was Khmer Rouge.On 11 April in Peking the US Government requested the immediate return of Prince Norodom Sihanouk, the figurehead leader of the National United Front of Kampuchea (FUNK), to Phnom Penh. Sihanouk rejected the request the following morning.\n\n\n=== 12 April ===\n\nWith the situation worsening in Phnom Penh, on 12 April the US Embassy initiated Operation Eagle Pull, the evacuation of all US personnel. Ambassador Dean invited the members of the Government to be evacuated, but all refused except for acting President Saukham Khoy, who left without telling his fellow leaders. The evacuation came as a shock to many in the Khmer Republic leadership, because not only Phnom Penh but almost all provincial capitals (except those in the east occupied by the North Vietnamese) were in the hands of the government, packed with millions of refugees. Estimates put the population under government control at six million, and those under Khmer Rouge control at one million.At 08:30, the Council of Ministers met in the office of Prime Minister Long Boret. It was decided that a general assembly should be convoked, consisting of the highest functionaries and military leaders. From 14:00 the general assembly sat in the Chamcar Mon Palace. It finally adopted a unanimous resolution asking for the transfer of power to the military and condemning Saukham Khoy for not handing over his office in a legitimate way. At 23:00 the general assembly elected the members of the Supreme Committee: Lieutenant general Sak Sutsakhan, the FANK Chief of Staff, Major General Thongvan Fanmuong, MNK Rear admiral Vong Sarendy, KAF commander Brigadier general Ea Chhong, Long Boret, Hang Thun Hak, Vice Prime Minister and Op Kim Ang: representative of the Social Republican Party.The military situation had deteriorated sharply during the day. In the north the defensive line was cut at several points by the Khmer Rouge, in spite of the fierce resistance by FANK units. Pochentong Airport was in imminent danger of being taken; the small military airport of Mean Chey had to be designated as an emergency landing place for the planes and helicopters bringing ammunition and supplies.\n\n\n=== 13\u201316 April ===\n \n13 April was the Cambodian New Year and the Khmer Rouge continued to bombard Phnom Penh. At 09:00 the Supreme Committee had its first session and unanimously elected Sak Sutsakhan president, becoming both the head of the government and interim Chief of State. Sak decided to make a last peace offer to Prince Sihanouk, transferring the Republic and its armed forces to him, but not surrendering to the Khmer Rouge. Late that night Sak called a meeting of the Council of Ministers, this time consisting of both the Supreme Committee and the Cabinet, made decisions including certain political and military measures, channeling the ever increasing stream of refugees into schools, pagodas, their feeding, the reshuffling of the cabinet, reinforcing the troops in Phnom Penh by flying in a few battalions from different provinces through the Mean Chey airport and the formation of an Ad Hoc Committee chaired by Long Boret to prepare peace overtures for either Prince Sihanouk or the Khmer Rouge.On 14 April the military situation was becoming increasingly precarious. That morning the Cabinet met at Sak's office at the General Staff Headquarters (11.567\u00b0N 104.925\u00b0E\ufeff / 11.567; 104.925). At 10:25 a KAF pilot dropped four 250-pound bombs from his T-28 fighter bomber. Two of the bombs exploded about 20 yards (18 m) from Sak's office killing seven officers and NCOs and wounded twenty others. Sak declared a 24-hour curfew and that the battle would continue. That afternoon Takhmau, the capital of Kandal Province, 11 kilometres (6.8 mi) south of Phnom Penh fell to the Khmer Rouge. The loss of this town, a key point in the FANK defense perimeter, had a demoralizing effect. Several counterattacks were initiated but to no avail. Soon a fierce battle was in progress in the southern suburbs. The U.S. aerial resupply into Pochentong was completely halted.The 15th began with the Khmer Rouge pressing in from north and west. Pochentong and the dike running east/west to the north of Phnom Penh, both of which formed the last ring of defense around the capital, were overrun by Khmer Rouge assaults. The intervention of the Parachute Brigade, brought back from the east of the Mekong, had no effect on the situation to the west of the capital. The brigade tried to move west, but was only able to get 6 kilometres (3.7 mi) down Route 4. Meanwhile, refugees continued to pour into the city.\n\nOn 16 April, the morning Cabinet meeting was devoted entirely to the mechanics of sending a peace offer to Peking as quickly as possible. Long Boret drafted the offer calling for an immediate ceasefire and a transfer of power to FUNK. The offer was sent to Peking via the Red Cross and the Agence France-Presse. The military situation was becoming worse, the Shell oil depot (11.607\u00b0N 104.917\u00b0E\ufeff / 11.607; 104.917) north of the city was set ablaze by gunfire, while fire swept shacks to the south of the city. All afternoon the Cabinet waited for the answer from Peking. By 23:00 an answer had still not arrived and the Cabinet realized that the Khmer Rouge did not want to accept the offer. Meanwhile, the Khmer Rouge had occupied the east bank of the Mekong following the withdrawal of the Parachute Brigade, while General Dien Del\u2019s 2nd Division held the Monivong Bridge.KAF T-28Ds flew their last combat sortie by bombing the KAF control centre and hangars at Pochentong upon its capture by the Khmer Rouge. After virtually expending their ordnance reserves, 97 KAF aircraft escaped from airbases and auxiliary airfields throughout Cambodia, with a small number of civilian dependents on board, to safe havens in neighbouring Thailand.\n\n\n=== 17 April ===\n\nAt 02:00 on 17 April the Cabinet agreed that, as its peace offer had not been accepted, it would move the Cabinet, the Supreme Committee and even members of the Assembly from Phnom Penh to the north to the capital of Oddar Meanchey Province on the Thai border in order to continue resistance from there. The only way to leave the capital was by helicopter. At 04:00 the members of the Government met in the garden in front of the Wat Botum Vaddey (11.559\u00b0N 104.932\u00b0E\ufeff / 11.559; 104.932) for evacuation, but the helicopters did not show up. Dawn was breaking over the eastern horizon. The Government members returned to Premier Long Boret's house at 05:30 and decided to resist to the death in Phnom Penh itself. After 06:00, the Minister of Information, Thong Lim Huong, brought a cable just arrived from Peking advising that the peace appeal had been rejected by Sihanouk. At the same time they branded the seven members of the Supreme Committee as chief traitors, in addition to the seven who had taken power in 1970.Heavy fighting had been taking place since 04:00 in the north of the city around the main power station (11.59\u00b0N 104.915\u00b0E\ufeff / 11.59; 104.915). By dawn the firing ceased as the FANK forces gave way to the Khmer Rouge and retreated along Monivong Boulevard into the city center. Admiral Vong Sarendy had returned to the naval base which was under attack by the Khmer Rouge. He called Sak later advising that the base was surrounded and about to be overrun. As Khmer Rouge forces entered the command post Sarendy committed suicide.By 08:00 the rest of the Cabinet, the deputies and the senators left the session, leaving Long Boret and Sak. General Thach Reng arrived to plead with them to leave with him, as he still had his men of the Special Forces and seven UH-1 helicopters at his disposal at the Olympic Stadium. At approximately 08:30 Sak and his family boarded a helicopter and were flown out, as was KAF commander Ea Chhong. Meanwhile, Long Boret boarded another helicopter which failed to take off. Four helicopters flew to Kampong Thom to refuel, arriving at 09:30. Establishing radio contact with Phnom Penh, Sak learned that the Khmer Rouge had penetrated into the General Staff Headquarters. General Mey Sichan addressed the nation and the troops in Sak's name asking them to hoist the white flag as a sign of peace. Sak's helicopter arrived at Oddar Meanchey at 13:30, as the collapse of the Republic was imminent. Any chance of reestablishing the Government evaporated and the assembled officers decided to seek exile in Thailand.As the Khmer Rouge entered the capital, a small group of soldiers and armed students, styled as the MONATIO and led by Hem Keth Dara, began driving around the city welcoming the arrival of the Khmer Rouge. MONATIO was apparently a creation of Lon Non, in an attempt to share power with the Khmer Rouge. Initially tolerated by the Khmer Rouge, MONATIO members were later rounded up and executed.Several hours later the Khmer Rouge began entering central Phnom Penh from all directions and stationed themselves at the major crossroads where they disarmed FANK soldiers and collected weapons. The disarmed soldiers were then marched to the Olympic Stadium where they were later executed. The Khmer Rouge held a press conference at the Ministry of Information where a number of prisoners, including Lon Non and Hem Keth Dara, were being held. A car carrying Long Boret arrived and he joined the prisoners.After midday the Khmer Rouge ordered the evacuation of the city for three days, evicting expatriates and Cambodians from the Hotel Le Phnom which the Red Cross had sought to establish as a neutral zone, and emptying the city's hospitals which contained approximately 20,000 wounded who were unlikely to survive the walk to the countryside. Approximately 800 expatriates and 600 Cambodians took refuge at the French Embassy (11.583\u00b0N 104.916\u00b0E\ufeff / 11.583; 104.916). At this time the Khmer Rouge military numbered only 68,000, with a further 14,000 party members. Elizabeth Becker asserts that lacking the numbers necessary to openly control Cambodia, emptying Phnom Penh of those of its population who were indifferent or openly hostile to them was essential for securing Khmer Rouge control.Koy Thuon, a Khmer Rouge deputy front commander, organized the \"Committee for Wiping Out Enemies\" at the Hotel Monorom (11.57\u00b0N 104.918\u00b0E\ufeff / 11.57; 104.918). Its first action was to order the immediate execution of Lon Nol and other leading government figures. Captured FANK officers were taken to the Hotel Monoram to write their biographies and then to the Olympic Stadium, where they were executed.\n\n\n== Aftermath ==\nOn the morning of 18 April, Sak and the remaining members of the Khmer Republic Government and assorted military personnel boarded a KAF C-123 and flew to U-Tapao and into exile. The same day the Khmer Rouge ordered all Cambodians in the French Embassy, other than women married to Frenchmen, to leave the Embassy or they would take it over; they rejected any right of asylum. Among those evicted was Prince Sisowath Sirik Matak, one of those responsible for the removal of Sihanouk from power in 1970 and who had been branded one of the seven original traitors marked for execution by the FUNK. Also evicted were Princess Mam Manivan Phanivong, one of Sihanouk's wives; Khy-Taing Lim, the Minister of Finance; and Loeung Nal, the Minister of Health.Long Boret was executed on the grounds of the Cercle Sportif in Phnom Penh (ironically now the location of the US Embassy) on or about 21 April. Khmer Rouge Radio subsequently reported that he had been beheaded but other reports indicate that he and Sisowath Sirik Matak were executed by firing squad or that he was shot in the kidney and left to suffer a slow death, while his family were executed by machine gun fire.Pol Pot arrived in a deserted Phnom Penh on 23 April. On 30 April the occupants of the French Embassy were loaded onto trucks and driven to the Thai border arriving four days later.The collapse of the Khmer Republic following the Fall of Phnom Penh allowed the Khmer Rouge to consolidate their control over Cambodia and begin the implementation of their agrarian socialism. Supporters of the Khmer Republic and the intelligentsia were killed, while the former urban population was used as forced labor in the countryside with many dying from physical abuse and malnutrition. This ultimately resulting in 1.5-2 million deaths during the Cambodian Genocide.The Khmer Rouge severed all contact with the outside world other than with its supporters, China and North Vietnam. With the Fall of Saigon on 30 April 1975 the Khmer Rouge demanded that all People's Army of Vietnam (PAVN) and Viet Cong forces leave their base areas in Cambodia, but the PAVN refused to leave certain areas which they claimed were Vietnamese territory. The PAVN also moved to take control of a number of islands formerly controlled by South Vietnam and other territory and islands contested between Vietnam and Cambodia. This led to a series of clashes between Vietnam and Cambodia on several islands in May 1975 and the seizure of foreign ships by the Khmer Rouge which triggered the Mayaguez incident. Clashes between Cambodia and Vietnam continued until August 1975. Relations between the two countries improved thereafter until early 1977 when the Kampuchean Revolutionary Army began attacking Vietnamese border provinces, killing hundreds of Vietnamese civilians; this eventually resulted in the Cambodian\u2013Vietnamese War starting in December 1978.\n\n\n== In popular culture ==\nThe Fall of Phnom Penh is depicted in the film The Killing Fields.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nVideo of Roland Neveu discussing his photos from the fall of Phnom Penh",

          "Visit to night market not all that thrilling. Stall after stall of the same thing. Fake copies of designer clothes, jewellery and watches. Watch out for pick pockets who work in groups to case you specially if you are a foreigner. Try to keep things to a minimum i.e. back packs",
          "The clothing stall section was small and there was someone singing on a stage. We enjoyed the food section where we chose skewers to be cooked and bought some sugar cane juice. All of the food was delivered to us as we sat on the mats on the ground. We paid after we ate.",
          "I walked here around 10.30pm the other night and they were already packing up some stalls. It's alot of clothes, watches etc and nice food at back for a late night snack.",
          "Be careful of cheating. One can be cheaper but hotel policy of charging money and holding guest id is favourable and secure",
          "My boyfriend asked me to go there for buy some cheao watch but with good quality,they can do offer price too and mostly nice watches branded one cost less than $20 but its copied not real yes! Haha i bought these 3 for totally $35",
          "It is quite small and cozy but the atmosphere overall is quite nice as the vendors are not screaming or hussling all the time. Moreover, I liked that a lot of the already had price tags which meant you don't need to deal with negotiating. The food was pretty good as well and you",
          "Walked round it in ten minutes flat. No fridge Magnets just the usual tat. Wasn\u2019t overlay impressed with the food stalls either.",
          "Went to visit this quaint little market at night which only clothing and accessories stalls. They had performances going on which was fun to watch - unfortunately there aren't any seats so you either sit on the floor or squat like the rest of the audience. The food area is",
          "Pretty average market. Good food with lots of stalls selling cheap knock offs from China. Other than that there are little gems found for souvenir just have to look well.",
          "The night market is pretty small. Most stalls selling clothes, majority at cost of US$3-5. There's 1 side with food and a sitting platform (mat on the floor). Nothing much.",
          "We have been to Russian market and Central market in PP so this Market was not at all what we expected. It has a lot of tourist things, nothing special. Smaller to then we thought. Central Market is better.",
          "Went to the Phnom Penh night market last night. It was disappointing. Very few food stalls and lot of vendors selling same thing. Food variety wasn\u2019t much. It\u2019s a small area with some shops. Not even close to a night market in Bangkok or other ones I\u2019ve been to in other Asian",
          "We enjoyed a simple ala carte dinner from random stalls while sitting and enjoying the naturally hot stone from the sun (almost like natural stones from volcanic sites) and shopped a little buying not as cheap as Thailand looking goods which they claimed are from Cambodia.",
          "We had dinner twice in its stands and where quite satisfied for less than 5\u20ac each. I recommend to experience its food at least once.",
          "Not as expected as night market, it\u2019s more like repeated shops selling reproduction goods ranging from branded brands of leather bags, clothing etc.. shops after shops not so much on local handy craft or souvenirs. Sellers were not that friendly as you would expect from the",
          "Cannot fathom how people tolerate the noise that is offered as \"music\". Intolerable. Products for sale and the market in general are not a shade on any other night market I have been to in the region.",
          "We went here twice, it is quite a relaxed laid back market with no hassle, easy to get to quite close to the waterfront. The usual staff up for sale clothes watches souvenirs bags etc",
          "This is definitely a market for the locals. We were looking for souvenirs and found nothing. There is live music and that was nice.",
          "It is really nothing much than any night market that i had been visited around SEA. Not worth to go.is just a small U shape market with stalls, less than 10 food stalls and others selling some clothes, i can not even get a clothes stall for a boy at age of 11, so it means their",
          "This is a good night market, lots to look at, good bargains, lots of food choices and areas to sit, with music entertainment. Good location, easy to get to. Great restaurant nearby - Golden Flamingo.",
          "When here from our river cruise boat. It was great. Watching locals out enjoying themselves on a balmy evening Lots of things to see and the vendors not too pushy Live music Definitely recommend",
          "There are lots of shops here selling local handmade products and art works. There are also lots of street food vendors here too. Not too crowded and prices are reasonable too.",
          "Given that the Central market and the Russian market (the Two premier tourist markets in PP) are closed at night I suppose one should be aware of this market. It\u2019s proximity to the riverside is also worthy of note. It\u2019s right there on the Sisowath quay, so afterwards if your",
          "I'm always a bit taken aback with reviewers who berate places \"because they've been to loads of Asian countries\" etc. Everywhere is different and should not be compared but enjoyed in it's own unique right - if you don't like it - go back home. Anyway, yes, there are many",
          "Must try is the ice cream on coconot which is $1 only per flavor with coconut and chocolate toppings and even a free fresh coconut juice plus great smiles from vendors as a bonus. Can't leave Phnom Penh without trying this night market",
          "If you into knock off brands incorrectly spelt then you will be at home here. The food may well be good but under the lighting it was hard to tell. I have see a lot of asian markets and I rate this one as pitiful. As a bonus, the surrounding streets appear to make up the red",
          "A nice little market located at the Mekong River and walking distance from our boat. Visited during the afternoon when storeholders were still setting up but they were happy to sell. I was thrilled with my purchases of brightly coloured items. At night it is lit up with music",
          "We walked to check out this market, it was the last night of our trip and we wanted to find some small gifts for friends back home. Found them here. Lots of clothes and random fashion stuff that we weren\u2019t too interested in but we found some cool little trinkets eventually. Big",
          "I arrived about half an hour after opening (it starts at 5pm) and it was still quiet so I went around fairly quickly. The clothing and souvenirs are the same as you will find in central market and the Russian market, didn't see anything unique. The food was interesting. Lots",
          "I like to do a tour of the local markets whenever visiting a new city, but was left disappointed by this one. First off, it took a real effort to get in and thru it - the plastic covers were roughly 5\u201d9 high and I\u2019m 6\u201d3. Secondly and obviously more importantly, it was all the",
          "Really enjoyed the market. lots of things to see and do that we are not accustomed to in South Africa. But probably will not go back because it is quite chaotic",
          "We went an hour and a half before closing. Pretty sad collection of stalls, some of which were packing up. Mainly clothes and food.",
          "Stopped by to shop for souvenirs and have dinner. It is a great way to immerse yourself in the local culture and food.",
          "Very relaxed feel about these markets. Stall holders don\u2019t hassle you at all. More clothes than other things but still has a mix and well worth a wander around. Plenty of food stalls at the back and live entertainment on the stage.",
          "Really cool to sit and eat with the locals, cheap prices and great food. One of the few places not looking to screw tourists!",
          "Most of the stalls here sell clothing. Stalls toward the back sell local roadside styled food and have portable kind of tables and chairs or mostly mats. Locals would dine together with family and friends on the mats so if you would like to get a feel and hang out with locals",
          "After dinner along 136 street, we continued to walk along Sisowath quay to the end where the night market is located. Fairly populated with mostly locals. I would not recommend this place to buy any local goods or clothes. The central and russian markets are better for that.",
          "After you have been through Asia a lot of things blend into each other. Night Markets are the same. You start to look for the difference, whats sets this market from the others. Well this one is just like all the others. Plenty of goods and food. Worth going but don' expect",
          "Quite depressing place - most of the selling stuff is very low quality, the prices are fixed , impossible to bargain. And it\u2019s dirty.",
          "The market stalls trying to sell you watches, handbags, shoes or whatever else are not the main attraction for me personally. The real market starts behind the podium where locals sell food from their stalls. Take your time to browse and then go for your favourite.",
          "Night market is ok for local souvenirs and cheap clothes,plenty of local food to taste,can get extremely busy so best to go early evening,because it's so busy with tourists it attracts all the ice head drugged that plague the riverside,so keep an eye on your bags and wallet,many",
          "The Night Market is made up of three main attractions: 1) Dry market selling clothing and souvenirs 2) A stage for song performance 3) F&B stalls selling fried skewers, ice cream, shakes, coconut and others. I was not too much into buying clothing or souvenirs, so did not",
          "Prices ok and lots of t shirts etc. Sellers generally pleasant except couple of rude sellers but that is normal. Not a good as other night markets such as Hanoi, but if you are here its worth visiting and its opposite where the boat trip pick ups are found.",
          "i was in Night market and the product price moderate compare with another south east asia market. Just becareful of the pick pocket around you, they will in group by 3-5 persons standing close to you and try to pick your wallet, my mom almost lost her wallet, the bag is opened",
          "Did you enjoy an evening stroll the wander along the promenade and you will pass the night market. Not too much there compared to the day market but worth a stop for the food stalls. Cooked to order and very cheap",
          "Ordinary, don't bother, go to Russian Market or Central Market instead. We were taken to the night Market by our tuk tuk driver one evening. He said 'you can go out the back and get something to eat'. We passed by a few stalls, mostly clothing, not much else. Out the back was",
          "We wandered through the night market. It has all the high end knock off products and would be fun if that\u2019s what you\u2019re after. Nobody hassled us to look or buy. There\u2019s amazing street food and entertainment. I\u2019m not sure if prices of items as we weren\u2019t shopping.",
          "We went looking for some street food during the night, it was hard to find when you don't know where to look and the only place I saw was here. They don't have everything but it was a good experience.",
          "Very friendly people here - next to river and plenty of restaurants and bars very close. Got some good deals on clothing..",
          "The market is hot and stuffy and cramped and very interesting to see! Try haggling with the locals at stalls and watch traditional cooking methods at the back of the market!",
          "After ordering the food at the stall , they assign you where to sit . The food is really so-so , just to gain some different Culture experience",
          "Nothing really to buy in there,just nice for a walk,spend a few minutes and maybe an ice cream but that's all.",
          "This was our first stop for the evening and found the stalls and goods for sale very average. However, it is a lot better than the Russian Market. Good for pickup and drop-off as everyone knows this place and it is walking distance to many restaurants.",
          "Out of all the markets in Phnom Penh this is probably the worst for goods as very cheap badly made imitation clothing glasses etc, nice for a quick visit but keep your money in your pocket cheap rubbish",
          "If you are in Phnom Penh and if you also have been to other south Asian countries, then you would be expecting night market in Phnom Penh as well. And your expectation is right. There is a night market here. It is very conveniently located in the tourist area by the river side.",
          "The market is not very large and largely clothes stalls dominate the market. A little bit of food but the location is great, near the quay and all the bars and hotels nearby.",
          "We took a Tuk Tuk from the hotel which was an interesting experience. The market is a large affair with a good atmosphere. Plenty of different stalls and a large are for diners. Well worth a visit",
          "It used to only open on Friday to Sunday but nowadays it opens every night just beside the bus station. I like the food there especially the one at the right corner staff with their own sitting available The porridge is teochew style and with pig blood in it that is",
          "Really enjoyed the night market. They have clothes ranging from authentic Cambodian styles across to Gucci bandeaus and Rolex watches. Something that anyone can buy. There\u2019s entertainment from when you step in, in our case a group of girls performing a beautiful dance; and then",
          "We thought this place was open only during the weekend as that\u2019s what\u2019s listed but they are in fact open every day of the week. Night Markets are usually fun but it wasn\u2019t so much fun here. I thought more would be happening since it was the Chinese Spring Festival but maybe they",
          "The place mainly have clothing & shoes for Cambodian + some street food available 5 minutes there was an off for me ...",
          "After walking whole day, sitting on the floor mats here to eat with shoes off felt so good to my legs and feet. There're table and chairs nearer to the shops for those who need. On the mats they provide paper tissue and bottles of chili and sauces and trash boxes. I bought a",
          "located in the heart of the city, just neat the riverside park. good and clean night market with temporary small shops. bright and nice. bit huge, small one.",
          "Seems most vendors are selling the same tshirts, jeans, blouses, skirts, and knock-off watches. You can walk through the whole thing in 15 minutes. Food is bbq and nothing else. Fortunately, most vendors don't hassle window shoppers.",
          "Lots of knock stuff for locals who buy and sell this merchandise. People watching is tops but to purchase a t shirt ...not so much.",
          "not actually a night market. closes 9.30-10 PM. but in front of the river, worth a visit. lots of bargaining, tourist place, so bit pricey for everything",
          "The night market at Phnom Penh was bustling with visitors and stalls.The sea front location of the market added to the charm. Variety of clothing materials were available, but the quality appeared to be a littly low in my opinion. The cosmetics on display also I didnt find very",
          "A small market place with some very average stuff being sold. Some of them even seemed to take branded stuff.",
          "Our river boat docked a few blocks away from the Phnom Penh's Night Market during one of our itinerary. Following dinner on boat, I'd walked to & around the market to work off the caloric intake. This market was in full swing, busy, colorful & full of life. Lots of stalls",
          "This is a must for shopping great prices,cultural atmosphere, entertainment and just walking around Phnom Phen at night gathering in local places to eat and and just sit and watch the people go past.",
          "Not as good as the Russian Markets but we were there early in the night so this may have had the dissapointing effect on me. Still there was plenty to look at but we bought nothing.",
          "Having been to a number of night markets throughout Asia, this is one of the best organised and cleanest markets I have been to. Key positives included: Good security; Immaculately clean food service and eating areas; Fantastic ice cream stalls; A live modern music concert by",
          "a small market mostly with souvenir but you can easily spend 2hrs there. must try the local food at the end. eat while sitting on the floor and embrace Cambodian culture",
          "Welll this is a kind of place where you go only once in your lifetime. When i first arrived in Cambodia people told me visit night market you will love it. so maybe i had an over expectation for this place. Well it is a market that you find in every south east Asian countries.",
          "Visited after a sunset cruise. It's well laid out and not cramped. The majority of the stalls sell clothes but there are also stalls selling leather bags & wallets & some jewellery. There's a stage in the middle where singers perform. At the back there are food stalls selling",
          "Cool place! A large variety of things. From jewellery to clothes, the market had pretty everything! And when you get hungry, just walk to the other side of the market and eat some nice food on carpets, haven\u2019t tried but looks real good!",
          "As in all markets the products are similar everywhere but with many good products if you are Looking for clothes. A large \u201dfood court\u201d with carpets as a big doning floor in the middle is situated in the market and looked very Pleasanton! We Found some nice products and the",
          "A must visit place for all tourists. Hundreds of stalls scattered in a concise area, where taxi and tuk tuk driver can\u2019t come in, but rushing after you leave. Well, a place to spend few hours, walking between the stalls, checking souvenirs and gifts, statues, clothes, belts and",
          "There are some locals at the food stills, but otherwise, this market is small and you're better off spending your time at the nearby Old Market.",
          "You find here clothes and food. Seating area is on the floor. It's a good value. No cars driving arou d in the market or bikes so that is perfect for walking around.",
          "Was a rainy night when I visited Pub street and I went to night market too! Unique souvenirs and fried insects \ud83d\udc1e for sale,not for the faint hearted! A beer \ud83c\udf7a cost around usd$1.50",
          "There is nothing exciting about the night market of Phnom Penh.....it is far off the standard set by Thailand. The things sold here are pretty normal and slightly overpriced. Avoid going there during rainy season as you will get drench there and then. Just drop by for a feel",
          "Not as good as Thailand's night markets but worth a look Watch out for the low strung tent ropes of you are tall",
          "We arrived at about 8.30pm when it was raining. Most of the stalls were closing. Some had canopies over but these are very low.",
          "The market is small and not very exciting. We came from Thailand where we loved the night market. We also liked the one is Siem Reap better - so if you are doing both cities, you can skip the Phnom Penh one!",
          "Not many night markets in PP, this is probably the biggest and best situated right there on Sisowath quay. More of a tourist attraction than a functional market such as Central/Russian/Orussey markets... Mainly T-shirts and collectibles... Very busy more due to its location than",
          "As night markets go, it's ok. We went to find a bite to eat. Lots of clothing stalls, watches by the wristful and bags galore.",
          "Been to many night markets and this one was disappointing. Lots of fake watches, narrow walkways and nothing of much interest. Don\u2019t go out of your way to visit",
          "Well, Its nice to pass by and see what this market has but I found it a bit expensive than other local markets \"its more touristic\" however you may still find there some unique things that hard to find in other places such as the Cambodia flag patch which I couldn't even find in",
          "The night market was a disappointment as almost all the stalls sold clothes with little variety between them. It\u2019s okay for a wander around if you have some spare time and it\u2019s not out of your way but go to either of the other 2 (Russian or central). My preference would be the",
          "We went down to the night markets one night to check them out. Not so big and selling all the usual market stuff, cheap t-shirts, watches, sunglasses, Buddha statues. A good selection of street food.",
          "Our visit to the night market was pretty ordinary. Most of the stalls sell the same stuff. It is pretty cheap and you can still bargain about price. The food stalls are pretty cool as they provide mats to sit on to eat your food after you purchase. The coconut icecream is a",
          "Place for locals and tourists alike. Not really much for sale, but they had some local singers doing their thing, which was fun to watch for a bit. Be like the locals and grab some street food and hang out on the ground.",
          "Pity the night Market is just a lot of mass produced products, but the gem of the night Market is the street food stalls. We had some fresh prawns and shared a Khmer Chicken Curry. They were great. Very tasty indeed. Prices are cheap and very very reasonable. There was also live",
          "Definitely a hangout spot for locals. Dont expect a huge market, or wide selections. Prices are comparable to Central market. Only open Friday - Sunday, and closes at 10pm. Food stalls in the back side are great, very inexpensive. Join the locals and other visitors on the",
          "This night market is not as good as one would find in Seam Reip or in Thailand. It has just t-shirts and knick knacks of cheap quality. One may look at little bags or slings, key chains etc but nothing great. There are no handicrafts or local products which are unique to this",
          "Not so great night market. Usual knockoff Asian items but a bit more expensive. Visit the central market for more authenticity or the Russian market for better selection",
          "They just clothes here and fake sunglasses and some street food Not really worth spending time here - walk past it There are some nice restaurants on walking towards the palace from the night market A Mexican - Cambodian one is good ( can\u2019t remember name ) Massage centres",
          "I am not the type who goes for streetfood but we tried everything and most of them are good. We even ate on the mats they have provided and find a lot of locals and foreigners enjoyed the same thing. Good finds on shirts, scarf , shawls, clothes and souvenirs that i filled about",
          "Cambodia is a magnificent place to visit. Phnom Pehn is a hidden beauty to see. PP night market is cheap and quite cheerful place to enjoy time here. One should visit",
          "May be on the tourist trail but honestly it's not worth going out of your way for. Usual mix of TTT typical tourist tat, clothing and some food stuffs.",
          "Not the night market I imagined, especially compared to Siam Reap night markets. Mainly for the locals. Only a couple of stores selling \u201cCambodian \u201c souvenirs Picked up a couple of scarves but overall I was disappointed",
          "Maybe influenced by the great markets in Siem Reap. Found this market to be extremely loud (some kind of karaoke stage), vendors unhelpful, good for some knock off merchandise but lacking variety as all the vendors are selling the same things. Didn\u2019t try the food so maybe I",
          "the night market by the riverside is vast and you will have plenty of things to do. other than shopping for varieties of items like clothing, shoes, other sorts of footwear, accessories, sunglasses, toys, antiques and other cheap goods, you are also spoilt with choices of what",
          "for a market this is the same as many night markets you will see in asia , same things for same but food wise plenty of choice and at a good price too",
          "It was fun to walk around on the night market. People were friendly. We ate at a food stand, it was the best food so far during our stay.",
          "There are all kinds of souvenirs to be had here, but I went for the food. The market is located in the city center, about a block away from the river and Oscar\u2019s Pub. All kind of foods available -I highly recommend the skewers! I will go back closer to the end of my stay to get",
          "Just a walk around but from what I could see very good & reasonable. Not being local, having the budget or the luggage space but lots to choose from, all sizes clothes wise. I\u2019d say: Leave your clothes at home. Buy from here. I also saw some fashionable shoes. Designer",
          "The night market only opens on Fri-Sun., closes by about 10pm. It is much smaller than Central market. It does not have fresh food like in Central market. However, the other items on sale are much cheaper than those found in day markets. There is a nice coconut ice cream stall",
          "The night market is a busy bustling night market full of clothing outlets of all descriptions and food outlets where you can select your own food and it is cooked in front of you . There is also a stage at the far end where singers get up and perform there songs not sure if it\u2019s",
          "Visited the market which is fairly small. The same stuff sold here as all other markets. Various food stalls and it\u2019s worth a visit.",
          "The night market has quite a number of stalls but lacking in diversity. All the clothing stalls would stock more-or-less the same designs. At least the prices are lower than the central market. There is a main stage on the centre, just before the food stalls, where",
          "Don't think this is much of a tourist market. Good to get food, but nothing all that touristy about it, though seemed to try to appeal to the tourists.",
          "Night market is not a very big market like Central market but good to go at the evening for a little shopping or window shopping and also eating at the backside. Very local food and style, eating on floor with good price. Recommend to go Do not forget to try Coconut Ice-cream",
          "I got here after eating some dinner across the street. It was roughly 9pm, when we walked around, a lot of the market stalls were closing up. Think they forgotten what night market means, most stalls were selling the same stuff. A bit of a disappointment, but the food stalls",
          "I can't really understand why this market is classed as a tourist attraction. It is like a small Sunday market, the sort you get all over the world. Most stalls are selling the same goods and the food area offers the same fare that you get on every street corner. Just to add",
          "(went here a few times on April and May 2016) Good food and beverages on the back of the market, very crowded aisles sometimes. Not great prices. It's cleaner than the traditional markets, but maybe too touristy. It's OK if you enter while walking on the side of the river.",
          "This market sells so many clothes, not so many thing you can find here. The food at 10 shops are same kind of food. You should spend time at Independent Monument or Naga World instead of this Market.",
          "I came here to find a fridge magnet but all the stores sell the same design and are quite expensive compared to Siem Reap. They sell a lot of clothes and various food options.",
          "The market is just row after row of clothing stalls all selling the same t-shirts and other items of clothing. It\u2019s OK to see but just walk one row with one hand on your wallet or you will get to the end of the row without a wallet. So after walking one row, walk across the",
          "Stopped by the night market and was pleasantly surprised. It is basically a large area that is fenced in like a large town square or town green. It is well organized with several rows of stalls selling clothes, purses, wallets, sunglasses and other items at decent prices. In the",
          "Phnom Penh is a good city. Ppl are so nice and respectful. Was here for 2 days, unfortunately I don\u2019t remember those days due to being wasted every night. But here are some photos.",
          "I was there with my best friend I thinking in capital city is the most expensive but not how I can told is cheaper dress I have buying is the best for for recommendations anyone to come there for best shopping",
          "The best hearts of city capital pheom phenh I was thee with my best friend she have live in cities one dressed is 5 $ how is cheaper market Please look our pictures",
          "Buzzy, busy place. Stage in the middle were local acts performed each night. We found it quite reasonably priced with lots of items priced. As many locals as tourists. Plenty of street food stalls around + lots of bars. Easy found facing the river",
          "Very average market for clothing, jewellery etc with a small section selling food where you can sit on mats or at a few tables and eat. You don't need to go out of your way to visit.",
          "Located just opposite the river side , it's a collection of shops for selling wares and lots of street food . A stage in the middle where artists sing live . Siem reap night market is definitely better",
          "Its a small area with plenty of stalls. Not much to see though. The food however was different as you could order and sit on the mats provided. Other than that there isn't much variety as almost all the stalls sold the same thing. but do try the grilled chicken! juicy and tasty!",
          "Don't go out of your way to come here but if you're around anyways, you should consider taking your dinner from one of the stalls. Not recommend for shopping, you get the usual stuff and some weird things locals wear (like those daytime pyjamas).",
          "The market itself is ok, can get $1.50 dishes and sit on matts. Grab a few bargains hats $2, shoes $4 etccc BUT.... we were being watched. As soon as we left we were followed and targeted for the infamous bag snatch that has become disappointingly common in Cambodia. It was my",
          "I really dont know many people say this night market is sparkling. I hardly found something different and interesting than other night market. Most of stalls sell almost similar clothes that you can easily find at day market, nothing special too for souvenirs stalls, no street",
          "Didn't understand why this was an Attraction. Only a handful of stalls and not really a \"market\". Big funfair but mainly all locals. Good to see and nice sunset on river but wouldn't come here just for market. Pic of sunset.",
          "You need to come with the right sort of expectations if you want to really enjoy this. You're not going to get much that you can't get on other markets- it's generally \"same-same\", but in Saturday nights they have live music - it's local and the locals love it! It's good to see",
          "This isn\u2019t anything like as good as the Russian Market or Central Market. Plenty of stalls but all selling the same or very similar stuff. Poor quality clothing options and lots of counterfeit t shirts etc. Has a few decent souvenirs but nothing that can\u2019t be bought elsewhere",
          "very small but cute night market with the normal things to buy, means fake clothes, watches and souvenirs...what i liked most is the place to eat at the end of the market, just sit down on the carpet and enjoy delicious local food!",
          "Its not as big as Siem Reap and not a comparison at all if one has visited Bangkok night market. Most of the locals do shop here. The shops too are geared to cater to locals. Though tourists do visit and shop the volumes are not big. But has a big food zone for street food.",
          "Hmmm thought it was lot bigger ,you walk around in 3 minutes and you have seen all lots of clothes cheap ones some food stalls ,and a scen but it was not what i expected,ok for see once but not again",
          "We come here and though just anither market with the same same. And owh yes the do have but we came in and there was some kind of singers/live music and on the back of that there was a foodcourt style zone with plates in the middle to sit. We took ice cream in a coconut",
          "The night market mainly sells clothing, shoes, bags.... Not a lot of interesting things for tourists, however if you are looking to buy cheap clothing it is VERY cheap (especially if you haggle). We found the atmosphere at the night market far nicer than the Central or Russian",
          "Having walked by the area in daytime when there is nothing, I was surprised to see it transform at night. The colorful stalls selling trinkets and stuff is nice to browse through.",
          "If you are in the area, then sure drop in. But it's nit worth the effort to go here as a destination. Go to the Russian Market during the day. Much larger and far more interesting",
          "Strolled out to the market from our hotel and when we got there it really seemed like a bit of a waste of time. Nothing really special at all. You can get all of the stuff elsewhere in the local markets. They have a food court behind the main stage - but I dibn\u2019t fancy eating",
          "It\u2019s not worth to visit market as they sale very cheap stuff. Huge stage has 1-2 performers but almost nil viewers. Don\u2019t waste your time.",
          "Nothing really to buy here. Waste of time strolling around. Tee shirts and other clothing items are mainly sold here. Many restaurants and bars in the area.not too crowded .",
          "Visiting night markets across Asia, this one really didn\u2019t impress me much. The food corner seemed interesting, especially as the seating area features no tables (people traditionally seat on the floor). Otherwise not much to see and do here.",
          "Very interesting cultural experience which is worth doing if you want to see how the locals interact in the evening. We didn\u2019t stay long but walked around and took some photos",
          "Good place to experience as a local night market. Since it is river front open air market, the air is quite refreshing. Limited offer to shop, mostly clothes and some souvenirs, watches, shoes, etc..One section of the market is picnic like food court where you have to sit on the",
          "No need to spend much time as it is food and inexpensive clothing but great to see how locals enjoy it. Open air rugs for eating.",
          "Market was clothes and food and little else. We would have eaten there but stalls with chairs were full and we are a little on the wrong side of age to be comfortable hunkering down on the ground to eat, walked around for 10 minutes and left. Would recommend for food if you can",
          "This is a open air night market and most of the stalls sell clothing items, although a couple of the sell footwear, oil and incense, etc. There is a stage at the centre where there was a performance when we visited. There are also several stalls selling food and drinks at the",
          "The night market was very underwhelming. Nothing special and quite disappointing. In comparison to Vietnam/ thailand and a very near neighbouring siem reap this is really nothing special. 7 years ago it was totally different. Clearly it's changed and not for the better.",
          "Visites this place to get experience about local marjet. We did not buy anything but we got a nice walking around to see the people",
          "Surely a great place to soak up local life. The food section in the back is particularly interesting. The market itself is lots of cheap wear and plenty of knock off merchandise. Still great to browse through the small corridors.",
          "The Market was a small but clean and not supper crowded so was nice to stroll and able to take your time and see the stales. But product is very limited and food selection is also limited",
          "Have visited many many night markets throughout Asia and this one was probably the most disappointing. If you have never been to one before then it is worth the excursion. But compared to other countries and cities, this has the same selection of cheap and cheaper goods that you",
          "If you're looking for cheap food, this is the place to be. I tried the fried mee and fried finger food and it was so-so. However, the coconut icecream is definitely not to be missed! it's still the best coconut icecream I have tasted so far. So cheap ($1.50) yet so good.",
          "We finished the things we wanted to do early, and while we were in the area anyway, we decided to come to the night market. We took a tuk tuk there from the main area, he wanted $2, we bargained for $1 and he said yes (but gave him $2 anyway cos we felt bad haha) The night",
          "The food at the night market is delicious. All the shops sell the same menu. For muslims, they only have one Halal shops. It\u2019s full of people everyday.",
          "Plenty of bargains to be had at phnom pehns night market.Great way to meet the locals with many food stalls to the rear of the market.Was a band playing when I was there,plenty of SD stalls with clothes shoes etc.",
          "If you have been to other night markets then would probably give this a miss, a lot of stalls ,some food places, alot less variety than siam reap markets,did not stay here long",
          "This market is nice to walk around and had a good atmosphere. There was a stage with people singing on. It was a bit small. I felt safe walking around as a solo female traveller. There are lots of tuk tuk drivers at the entrance for you.",
          "Worth spending an hour or so to browse around. Limited stalls with mainly clothes. Better value here than at Central or Russian markets and much friendlier stallholders. There is a food area with carpets to sit on mainly used by locals.",
          "the market is nice, and is easy to find, nice lighting to find your way around. they offer a variety of local stuff as well as international goods. it was a nice to vist",
          "After dark it was time for our private version of I'm a celebrity get me out of here. An exploration of street food, leaping from course to course by tuk-tuk, began at the stalls selling deep fried insects. We applied the same rule to stalls as we do to restaurants, always go",
          "Went to the Night Market expecting lots of stalls selling all sorts of ware but it's just kids carnival rides, overpriced at that. There is a convenience store, if you call this a market, selling a few clothes and everyday groceries.",
          "I got here about 6.30pm on a Friday evening and it seemed like most of it was already open, however most talls just sell the usual low quality stuff of t-shirts, shorts, shoes, belts and cheap bags. Not sure if a real bargain can be made here. Maybe it can be useful if you",
          "Was impressed with the night market. You can buy different snacks or drinks from this place and people are friendly",
          "If you want to kill some time ( and don\u2019t value yours) go to these markets. It\u2019s well below average compared to others of this type in Asia. Lots of locals, and some suspicious looking characters ( keep hold of your money and personal belongings) this place is the perfect",
          "So the market is ok to browse I guess if you want to pick up some cheap clothes (although Siem Reap is cheaper), but it just seemed to be the same stalls on repeat. There is a small street food area, however every stall sells the same food and drinks. Majorly lacking in variety",
          "Interesting mixture, there was a stage where various local performers were doing their thing, a food area at the rear, and the usual stalls. More locals than tourists, not really my thing but a lot of people would enjoy it. I liked the Russian Markets better, but possibly",
          "This night market is more cooler to shop than Russian market and smaller than central market. So you will find it more worth a visit here. There are food selling here too.",
          "Good night market and fun to visit for shopping and eating. The new container night markets are more exciting and is where the locals and expats go.",
          "Market here lacks the life n vitality n variety of Siem reap night markets . Somehow or other the buzz is missing\u3002 Ok for first timers n those who haven't been to Siem reap first.",
          "This is an interesting night market to look around and experience, however, it is much more geared to local Cambodians with a lot of inexpensive clothes etc. Cheap prices if you find something you want.",
          "Plenty of options to choose from and rates are cheap. Many shops can see the hanging price rate 2.5USD for all items(shirt,pant,shorts,watch,belt,shoes etc..). But need to cautious while purchasing. Good place to kill the time.",
          "The night market in Phnom Pehn is an interesting place to shop if you are looking for things that are not expensive and it is a great place to meet people. Don't miss it when you got to Phnom Pehn.",
          "Visited the night market during my trip in September. The market is home to a hundreds of shops that sell thousands of things. A lot of them sell unique stuff and its a shopping paradise as items here are dirt cheap. I got 5 fridge magnet for 2 USD.",
          "Arrived at close to 11pm. but as we were walking through the market, the shop keepers were also starting to pack up. Many shops selling clothes inspired by hype. Didn't bother to check the prices as nothing was interesting enough. The foods at the market seemed catered to the",
          "Worth a visit. Great deals to make on traditional souvenir stuff and clothes.. Just remeber ALWAYS be great at bargaining.",
          "Mostly clothes for local and daily wear, not much souvenir or take-me-home items. Dont expect it to be anything like the Night Market in Siem Reap (if you've been)",
          "This is more a local's market so don't go there expecting the t-shirts, watches & souvenirs that you can get at Central Market.",
          "We went and had a look in here on our first night in the city. It was not fantastic and had the usual clothing bits and pieces as well as touristy type items. A lot was the same although there was a very interesting talent quest or karaoke going on while we were there. Also,",
          "The night market was small and all the stalls were very similar, compared to other city night markets I thought it was very poor. There was a stage with entertainment, although that term is used loosely, and a food area, but all the food was the same, there we no treats or",
          "With all of the food stalls in the Night Market, its not hard to find something to eat. There is a wide range of food; fried noodles, fresh springrolls (Classic Khmer dish), deep fried shrimps, soups and so on. Take a styrofoam plate with food, sit down on the mats on the ground",
          "Market is busy, with several options. It is somewhat covered which helps when it is raining. Be ready to bargain. Don't buy anything for the price asked. The food options seem to be really good. A very good setting towards the back of the market. Although there are so many",
          "Not being a fan of markets, it was hard to warm to Phnom Penh Night Market, even though it has a much more intimate, \"local\" feel than the Central or Russian Markets. Visiting out of season, we were probably the target of more individual attention - and spruikers - than when",
          "This place has so much to offer,music, food, drinks, clothes, accessories, shoes... The food is inexpensive and drinks are cheap!! The coconut ice cream comes highly recommended, 3 scoops of ice cream with tender coconut and a glass of coconut water!!! We loved the night market!!",
          "it was located right next to Giant Ibis Bus terminal in PP. i went to have a look for some souvenirs but unfortunately it was more local bazaar than a tourist site for shopping. i managed to find only one stall where they`re selling some fridge magnets & small statues. Even",
          "It is interesting place to look for some clothes and other stuff. I got to buy pants with just 5 USD. They also have someone who sings on the stage to entertain while you re on shopping. Bargain bargain bargain and you will get it cheaper",
          "The phonm Penh night markets on the corner of 106/108 street and riverside is open 5 nights a week ,( Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday, Sunday from 6pm till 11 pm . It's the best time to look for that bargain ,as it's very cool being after dark ,as the day markets can",
          "I love a good Asian market but this is terrible. Tshirts and cheap toys you can get for better prices at the Russian or central markets. Food is ok but not worth going.",
          "Went to this market which is nearby our hotel after dinner. This is a night market where you can find cheap bargains for the T-shirts and souvenirs here...Those souvenirs sold at the Central/Russian Market is quite expensive and requires a very good bargaining skills. The food",
          "The Night Market is worth a visit as you can stick it at the end of your day, it's open from 5pm every day. It's small enough to walk around within an hour, and there are bargains to be found. Many of the items here will be cheaper than at the larger markets of Central Market &",
          "We felt that the market was no different from what you see otherwise. It was crowded, cheap stuff and the overall cleanliness was poor.",
          "I found this market to be more expensive than both the central market and the russian market. There was not many people there.",
          "We went to the night market after our river cruise. Very much the usual market stuff, but without the phone cases and electronics. Big central stage where locals can stand up and perform was fun to watch, and some were very good. Some food out the back, but not enough for a",
          "The food was okay and a little cheap. They have a mat set up all over the ground where you can sit and hang out with your friends. You can do something like a \"night picnic\".",
          "For me i didn't really find it attracting as i have nothing to do with night life But there were Pubs everywhere and many massage centres and bars and a bit less amount for food sellers and almost nothing else as far as i saw cuz we stayed there only for one night",
          "This is not the optimum place for shopping. There are several stalls that sells the usual touristy trinkets and other what nots but the highlight of this night market are the local food and the manner of eating it. Here you will find people sitting on mats and eating in a",
          "This is a nice market that is more about clothing and wallets etc etc. It is used extensively by the local youth. Whilenitnis in the river tourist district, the tourists are watered down a lot here with locals so great atmosphere and if you have teenage kids they will love it",
          "The part we went to was mainly food. There are stores selling many different type of food, with the most common offering different local dishes and rice. We bought some roasted pork which was fantastic, there were barbecue fishes and one store with leg of lamb for barbecue.",
          "If you have some free time to kill. Why not take a short tour at nigh market. You can find variety of clothes, jewellery and some local food. This market is pretty small so don't put you expectations up. Do watch out, as it can be crowded.",
          "The night market can be a bit crowded at times. There is plenty of stuff to buy if you want souvenirs and clothing. The music is loud which is typical in Cambodia. You can also buy fast food (both Western and Asian style). My favorite thing about the night market is the ice",
          "Cheap and good quality food, loved the omelettes. Lots of different choices and a good atmosphere with friendly service",
          "Just returned from a fabulous 10 days touring Cambodia with InsideAsia travel company. It was a tailor made trip and included temples, night markets, the Killing Fields and two days on an idyllic island (Koh Rong). Can't fault the company for organising an itinerary that suited",
          "This night market sells mainly clothing, bags and electronics. Nothing ethnic or typical of Cambodia. There is no crowd so that tells you about the popularity of this market with locals and tourists. Its better to take a stroll elsewhere.",
          "Nice deals...one has to bargain a lot...good stuff... good night Life scene at street 130 , 136.. women shopping Paradise. Men limited choice..\ud83d\ude00",
          "The Night Market seems to have been borne of necessity, a grocery store and clothing market for locals who work daytime. There are food kiosks, but dubious cleanliness exists. People who prepare food also handle money, but have no place to wash hands. Many clothing stalls",
          "It was worth going to have a walk around, but we didn't stay for ages. There were quite a lot of stalls but it seemed like a lot of them had the same stuff for sale. Had a nice juice though",
          "We went to the night market tonight hoping to grab a bite but left disappointed before even ordering anything. The offering is basically the same across all vendors, skewers of all kinds, all looking like they'd been made in the same factory. There are a few drinks stands to",
          "A lots of stuff here you can bargain at the night market. they also have a mini concert here to sit and eating at night market, unfortunately no table to. you have to sit on available mat there. You should try their sugarcane juice! Very delicious and affordable This is a",
          "Night markets are usually exciting vibrant places. This was basically a clothes market with little interest for the tourist.",
          "It's \"just\" one of those night markets, nothing exceptional about it. Ok for a walk. Lots of clothing stuff on sale. I found the food section most interesting",
          "The night market was chaotic . A very large selection of goods. There is a food court where people sit on carpet and eat their food. On Saturday there was a local show with singers. I would be very cautious in this neighbour. You have to walk on the road because side walks",
          "Night market selling foods, clothing, and accessories and crowded with locals. The size is not big and could be done in less than 30 mins. There is a stage at the center with on-going performances (i.e. singing and dancing). Food stalls are generally selling the same kind of",
          "Nothing to recommend it. Many small stalls selling cheap goods and copies. A cramped and busy market.",
          "Possibly when we visited the new (temporary?) container market drew away some of the more interesting vendors, etc. We did a 30 min walk through - not much of a market - lots of cheap clothes, etc. Most interesting was the food vendors - large group of them circle a common",
          "The night market was just a few blocks from my guesthouse so i thought i would take a stroll there before dinner, bu as it happened there were several food stalls at the far end of the market and i ended up eating two fresh spring rolls that were very tasty. There were several",
          "I found the day markets better than the night markets. Central Markets have more items and in the daylight you can see what you are buying, try them on and barter with the store holders.",
          "A nice small market at on Preah Sisowath Quay. Plenty of stalls to wander through in the evening and food market at the rear with plenty of choices. Have a walk along the Quayside before and after, enjoy a couple of relaxing hour's.",
          "If you have seen the Russian or central market you don't REALY need to come here, the only difference is the night. Fresh food and live music available I think in about 1 hour you have seen everything. Not the biggest market in Asia. I liked it but you don't miss anything",
          "Definitely worth visiting the night market if you can. Mainly fixed prices, cooler temperature after dark and items available were different to what we saw at Russian Market. Live music as well",
          "You can come here for halal food and beside this stall have coconuts ais cream..you should came here to try.",
          "A small market but no push or pressure to purchase .. you can walk freely through the market without being harassed. Try the coconut ice cream in the food area.. comes with a free coconut water..",
          "It is not huge & it basically offers clothes, shoes and some food. We found a few things here and had a nice time walking around for about an hour. I think that this market opens at 5pm.",
          "Came here on the first night. Not the best markets we've seen but it's worth a look. Have some fun haggling for some cheap t-shirts and check out the food stalls. They're probably not for the faint hearted but I had some really good fried rice noodles with beef. If you see it",
          "Lots of locals, lip syncing karaoke to country and western songs was a little odd but just adds to the general wierdness of Cambodia...same prices as other markets..easy to find..even the tuktuk drivers know where it is! Remember to haggle over the price for everything except",
          "Similar to most night markets in SE Asia, cheap clothes etc... What makes this market stand out was a huge area of rugs to relax on, spent about 90 minutes meeting fellow travellers, eating food and sharing stories at this market.",
          "Usually the night markets in SE Asia are some of the best ones. But again I was disappointed. No variety. Same stuff you can get at any other market in Phnom Penh. Had a stage with people talking or singing. And street food vendors at the back. Not fussed. Didnt buy anything.",
          "This market is nothing special and there are other far better markets in Vietnam. If you are passing have a walk around but I wouldn't go out my way to visit.",
          "Since it's the market, the quality of the food is just ok. It is nice place to hangout tho since they have pretty space area for you to stay for long time. The fried noodle and ice cream there are good. I like chocolate taste with some coconut and peanut on top. It's also nice",
          "Took a quick walk around the market. It's not too big, mostly stalls with knock-offs. And they're REALLY bad knock-offs. But then again, that's probably why most of them are quite cheap.",
          "Lots of basic clothing and only a few tourist-y stalls. The back half was entirely a food market which looked worth visiting but unfortunately we didn't get to it! If you're looking for souvenirs give this one a miss!",
          "It is a nice market to visit but quite small! I had really good cheap food there and it was nice to see it but nothing special! I also must say I was on nicer Night markets before in Cambodia!",
          "Visited the night market in january 2014 and again in february 2017. It has improved with less noisy sellers and more genuin market feeling. Most of the market is for T-shirts, sunglases and watches, but also food were you sit on nice carpets in the market. There was live music",
          "My husband and I visited this market on our fist trip to Cambodia. We received lots of encouragement to visit this market on our trip. It was a great place to people watch and wander around. But I realized there was a lot of stuff that I didn't need! Dark and dingy and many",
          "The front half are the market stalls - lots of clothes, plastic stuff - nothing exciting. At the back are food stalls - the food looked amazing! I got a strawberry smoothie and for dinner we had chicken fried rice and spring rolls but there were so many different things to eat",
          "We came here on a Friday night, after walking along the riverfront from the FCC. I guess we expected something bigger and a bit more atmospheric. There were non-descript clothing and knick knack stalls at the front and food and drink stalls at the back. I was hoping to see some",
          "Maybe it is my comparison to the livelihood and excitement that Thai markets offered, but I did not necessarily enjoy this market. It is very small, and the food was not appetizing at all. Everything at each stand was the exact same, and only one or two nights a week the",
          "Cheap clothes, locals just hanging out, market stalls with the same items. This was such a disappointment. I probably stayed 15minutes in total. And that's only because there was a stage with live singing. Even then it wasn't worth staying. There aren't many tourists which",
          "This is a market with several clothes and jewelry stalls, where you can buy good scarfs mainly. Everything else is a bit cheap, but you can have an interesting experience having dinner on top of the tapestries where you'll have the food delivered by the vendors where you've",
          "Not the biggest market I've visited on my journey round SEA and I found that most of the clothing was of a lot poorer quality and was a lot tackier than other markets. It also felt like nearly every stall was selling the same stuff. If you want to eat food at the market be aware",
          "The night markets are interesting and vibrant places. However, there is a certain sameness to them. The Phnom Penh version is no different. If you are looking for some reasonable imitation products, then it is a good place to shop. Remember to bargain and haggle. It is",
          "An ok i said want to buy things make sure bargain wisely.. But i love their food section where if you want to seat you need to seat on the floor... I love that.. Btw i love their lovely sugarcane water because they add lime on it a sweet one of the lovely taste",
          "This is a horrible market, nothing decent at all. Rows of cheap copied clothes, bags and underwear fit for the bin. The area is dimly lit and doesn't feel safe at all, do not go here.",
          "Was hoping to get a fake watch. However no stall would go below 30 USD so not that cheap I don't think. Busy and good energy. Taste of local life",
          "I loved this cute little market - not for the shopping as there are not really a lot of stalls but for the atmosphere and food. At the back of the market is a wide assortment of good fresh street food and picnic rugs laid out so you can soak up the atmosphere. There is also a",
          "We visited this place in the hope of finding good local food and some cheap bargains similar to Bangkok's Patpong night market but the two just don't compare. The food stalls were a half-dozen bbq and noodle soup stalls which the local shopkeepers patronise more than the western",
          "The night market starts from around 5 pm and closes after midnight. We went on a Sunday when it was bustling with locals as well as tourists. You'll find several stalls selling cheap clothes, accessories, souvenirs and local food. We bought quite a few t-shirts, shorts, harem",
          "Night Market was an experience, busy with locals....tourist trap for sure, everything seemed to be $5 lol...Haggle. We found a Halal Malaysian food stall, think it was stall 13, cheap local foods served in the food court area...you have to it on the floor and eat. Great",
          "I've seen better night markets. Food stalls looked decent but not great. Not a bad stop to check out if PP is your only destination in SE Asia.",
          "I went here twice, but both time it was raining. So I did not get to very much enjoy the night market. But from an overview it does not look very big or very exciting like other night markets in SEA. BUt if you are already there, better just see it.",
          "This is not the best place to buy stuffs. But a good place to have a feel of a night market here. There are things to see and there's a big stage where there are performances too.",
          "Only open on weekend nights this place was packed with locals. Is interesting to walk through and see the local food etc, but nothing really for the general tourist here.",
          "The stalls carry mostly clothes that the sellers purchase at the Russian market and resell here at a higher cost, according to what locals have told us and what we were able to compare. I purchased a large oil painting at Siem Reap for $30 and the same one here was going for",
          "Small night market. Live entertainment while we were there. streets surrounding the market have good cambodian local restaurants, we had amazing fresh coconut ice cream in a coconut shell at this market. Not as great as the night markets of Thailand, but a good way to spend",
          "It's a night market like many others in Asia. It sells cheap T shirts, souvenirs, bits and pieces, can't see why it gets negative reviews. It's a fun place to hang out for an hour, if your looking for cheap goods and get upset when you can't get them don't moan about it... Go",
          "It's not as bad as other reviewers have put it, it's just meant for the local people, not tourists from the West who expect more fashionable styles of clothing and jewelry. I probably only saw one stall that sold souvenirs. A small market by comparison to other markets in SEA.",
          "Under the phnom penh night sky, the breeze from the riverside, that loud local artist music, the sit-on-matress eating style... Love it and love it!! Too bad this app makes it so difficult to browse pictures in my phone. If not I will have some to show. Im sure if you could",
          "Apparently, a must see destination. It took me 15 minutes to complete. The clothes are shabby & everything is grubby and looks like it needs a good wash. Unfortunately, the markets in Thailand, put it to shame. If it's near to where you're staying, then fair enough, but I",
          "Great opportunity to sample the local food . Pick out the food you would like to try then sit on the communal mats and the vendors will deliver your food once it is ready. A good way to feel part of the local scene",
          "These markets are nowhere near as large as other Asian markets but are very enjoyable! They are not as crowded as a normal marketplace and the items are very cheap even by imitation standards The stall holders allow you to look around without harassing you, the prices are set",
          "We didn't go out of our way to visit and went at 5:30 just as it was opening. Very small and not unique. Fine to visit if you are nearby but wouldn't make a special trip.",
          "I wish I had believed the other reviews. This was a sad market, likely the worst I've been to anywhere. See my other reviews for Phnom Phen",
          "Just a stroll around before dinner. If you are not clothes shopping or looking for cheap watches there is not a lot to see. However good atmosphere and street food can be eaten together on mats. If you are there just for the atmosphere stick to the wider aisles as you can get",
          "Good to see and check it out but seemed mostly like a market for locals buying clothes and shoes. They have a lot of food stalls. Worth it if you are close by for a stroll through but not worth going out of your way to see it",
          "If you went to the Russian Market, you'll want to head on over to the Night Market too because the bargains are at amazing prices. You'll find anything from clothes, accessories and costume jewellery, souvenir t-shirts and more. They're not as open to bargaining as they are at",
          "Love this night market. We tried a different place to eat on 2 visits during our last stay and loved the street food. Good selection and tasty. Got some great bargains on clothes and souveniers",
          "Done a lot of Asian travel and this market is the worst. Rows and rows of cheap clothes but all the same!!! Equally cheap kid's toys and rubbish hair clips etc. not worth going. Food ok but food is everywhere.",
          "This market didn't particularly stand out for me in any way. I'm glad I went for the experience but I wouldn't recommend going out of your way to see this market. If you're in the area and/or want cheap local foods, then this is a good place otherwise, the other markets are more",
          "This place is not a place that is a must to visit but can come to fill your stomach when you are hungry at night whereby there isn't any restaurant that open late. The food serve in every store are the same so don't bother source around. It either deep fried or BBQ. There is",
          "Might be because of the water festival, but there is really not much to see, do or buy. Most of the stalls just sell clothes. And some sell food. Then I would preferred something with more variety :)",
          "All the food stalls sell the same food - and everything was deep fried. Clothes were all knockoffs and expensive and we caught someone trying to pickpocket us twice",
          "Low quality of goods, vert cheep, street food.... At the oposite side a good restrain exists and an Italian stile food complex",
          "Located very close to the central market, this is another excellent shopping place...they even have some stage performances for entertainment and the better part is that it is open every night now!",
          "Very similar to the daytime markets, not much difference in the retail stalls. Perhaps slightly higher prices. We were happier at the food stalls. Here there is a reasonable variety to choose from, although most of the items are fried... Go to a stall, load a small basket with",
          "I love a market. It's one of the first things I want to do when I land in a new city; check out the local market. Not necessarily to buy anything, but to check out the locals, see what they're selling, maybe grab a bite to eat. I went to Phnom Penh's Night Market about 8:00 pm",
          "Similar to those stuff you could get from Central/Russian market. Clothes, handicrafts, bags. Not a good place for a visit during rainy season",
          "We went to Phnom Penh's night market and it was nice. The stalls are nothing special, pretty much the same things everywhere, but if you want to get cheap and nice cambodian food sitting on the floor with locals, then that's your place! Not bad!",
          "Worth a look but its the same old stuff loads of T shirts dresses watches etc not much that is different, once you have had a look for 10 min i found it a little boring mostly tourist stuff !!",
          "Come here in night hours. Life music, cheap clothes and a lot of cheap local junk food. This is great place to start communications with locals . Just take some food here and stard relaxing :)",
          "Poor even by tourist market standards. Not a lot of stalls and those there are are all very samey. Worth a 10 min stroll then walk into the back streets and see the real Phnom Penh - makes you feel ashamed you haggled the last 50c out of the tuk tuk driver!",
          "When tentages are set up, it goes so low that you have to bend down the majority of the time (that's if you are 1.73m in height. The market features stalls that sell clothes, electronics, accessories and jewelry for both genders, and food generally for the locals. There's a",
          "This was a bit of a disappointment. We had gone there only to find a small square space with around 25 shops. Some people were up on the stage singing and the stage had a sign of happy new year in the middle of September!!!",
          "There are rugs in the middle near the street venders, we all got a selection from the different vendors sat down and tried what each other found. Great food and perfect enjoyed with one of the many types of soft and alcoholic drinks available.",
          "I enjoyed this market more than others. Its not a huge market. Very easy to walk around and it wasn't as busy. I felt I could take the time to look at things and not be harassed like in Central Market. There was a food section with some seating and there was also a stage with",
          "A must visit in the evening when you are in Siem reap. Great night life from dinner to bars. Be careful with the foot massage locations in every corner. Many of them you get massaged by very young kids. Try the foot massaged by the fish if you dare. Good defoliant experience",
          "This market sells mostly handicrafts, some clothes, and a variety of snacks/bbq. The merchandise here is pricey and can be found for half the price at the Russian Market (Toul Tumpoung)",
          "Interesting collection of food, souveniers, clothes, even singing on the stage by local khmer singers. Good place to come check out, by some things for presents, have a bite to eat, but watch your wallet!",
          "This place is mainly for tourists, so you get your typical tourist stuff there (shirts, shoes, souvenirs, etc.). It also has a place to get some good street food, where also the locals sit on carpets on the ground and eat.",
          "The place offers a range of Khmer and western dishes to try. The market offers a lot of stuff to buy the major ones being the apparel and souvenirs. When I went there, there was some local song and dance events going on at the centre stage.",
          "A small market selling mainly clothes but if you go to the back you can get some really great cheap food. We had a really good chicken curry with noodles for \u20ac1.75, pork skewers for 50 cents each and coconut ice cream, served in a coconut for \u20ac1.25 you sit on mats to eat the",
          "The stalls here offer cheap clothes and souvenir but there are limited choices and rather small, catered more to locals. We covered the entire night market in just less than 30 minutes. But the typical massive Bangkok or Vietnam night markets. The surrounding places have good",
          "The market itself is nice but not amazing. The cool part is getting some food at the back of the market, sitting on mats with locals and people watching. The coconut ice cream makes a great dessert!",
          "This market is not too bad but no big deal. Although it's not very crowded or loud it's a little shy on quality stuff. My favorites are the $2.50 Ray Ban knock offs, silk scarfes and flip flops. If you're a big boy over a N.American size 48 you really have to hunt for clothing",
          "A good place to shop and have dinner all fresco - sitting down like a picnic. If you have knee problems , you can find some hawkers with tables and chairs. Noodles. Fruit juices, sugar can water, local salads and lots more..as for shopping you can get clothes and house hold",
          "This night market is quite small and seems to be geared mainly to locals, with stalls selling mostly clothes. We have been every night of our stay in Phnom Penh for dinner as the food is cheap and it has a nice atmosphere. There are only a few stalls, located behind the stage,",
          "The only night market to be shut and we checked it would be open and it wasn't. We met people who had been and they said it was one of the cheaper night markets but we did not get to find out! \u2639\ufe0f",
          "This is a night market that has stores selling quite a variety of items ranging from t-shirts to slippers and food. It isn't huge, in fact, if you do not stop at any of the stores, you'd probably be done with this night market within 10 minutes. Towards the back of the night",
          "Wow! This place is huge and has many many things to buy. All very cheap and they accept American dollars, and preferred it to other currencies. Cheap jewelry especially the jade. Need much time to shop here or bring a list. You get overwhelm easily. And it is so humid and hot.",
          "I'm generally not a fan of night markets (too crowded, too loud, too stressful). This one was quite nice though. Not too big, good and fresh food, stage for some entertainment. Cloths did not meet my quality expectations, but I assume that will be the case at all night markets.",
          "The Night Market takes place Wednesday-Saturday nights. There's a stage for singing and dancing entertainment; there's lots of clothing to buy; there's an array of food stands with new things to try. Spend 15 minutes or two hours--it's great for people watching!",
          "Completely underwhelmed by this place. Basically it's a market selling fake goods. No real local slant to it which was disappointing. We had hoped to find more stalls with local artifacts.",
          "Better than the Russian Market....still same same but they had food stalls at great prices and you could sit on the ground amongst the locals. Clothing is cheaper here, I paid $2.50 for a dress.",
          "the location is nearby Bus Terminal and Mekong River Side. Easily to find, can refer to the travel maps. I would to recommend the BBQ food, is cheaper than restaurant menu. Remember take care your wallet as well. Thank you.",
          "I found these markets to be well organised and inexpensive. Many stalls are selling the same things but there is a bit of variety and I noticed prices for some items were cheaper than in the other markets in Phnom Penh. Most clothing was between $2 and $5. There is also some",
          "I thought the night market would be full of crafts and arts and something authentic but it was like the same stuff you found at the Central Market. I was disappointed by the market.",
          "I was there on business. So on the off chance that you have time. Go and get the best bargains. Note that if you are worried about the fakes. Most likely they are the genuine and clothing made in a cambodian factory. That is you can also be ripped . But go with eyes open. And",
          "I had my phone and credit cards stolen in the throng of people in the narrow alleys of this market. There's nothing of interest here that can't be seen in other markets and local friends have said that it's got a reputation for being a tourist take down place. No real good",
          "It is a nice experience seing a market like this. If you are in the area you must see all the things they are selling. It is impressive.",
          "Local market not geared towards tourists. You can find cheap clothes, sunglasses, etc here if you need them. Aside from the clothes and things, you will find food vendors at the back with fresh spring rolls, noodles, and seafood of every variety. Prices are very reasonable and",
          "A small market compared to others in town better visiting them than this one. Would only recommend if you are after a cheap meal the food is pretty good.",
          "Went there tonight...very wet and very local. Sells mostly cheap looking knock offs and loads of watches. Food stalls selling pig ears and tongue skewers. Had some spring rolls...not the best. I would skip it and rather explore along the river where there is an amazing",
          "On the night we went, mainly clothing stores and small section of food store. If u want fruits and fish and vege visit the old market. Just behind the night market This night mrk is not excellent according to my view",
          "An average little market, if your looking for higher quality your better off to go to Central or the Russian market. If your on the riverside it's always worth checking this out at least one time.",
          "There are umpteen markets in Phnom Penh, most of which operate during business hours, with only one whose formal purpose is to run at night. Located on Riverside, the Night Market opens on Fridays, Saturdays, and Sundays. Not only does the market provide diverse street food",
          "For one dollar you can get a reasonable portion of food. Add $0.50 dollar for a drink. And your good. Enjoy your meal with the locals on the floor on a carpet. There is some live music. And some shopping in a market style.",
          "Personally, I do not enjoy visiting the night markets. Probably because I can't fit into a size 6 dress. However, if you're looking for affordable clothes, or wanting to taste some local food, then this is the place for you. Occasionally they have live music and dance",
          "It is a night market which selling lots of daily things include clothes, vegetables, fruit and so on. There are some tourists sit on picnic map and enjoy dinner as other local people. They looked enjoyable.",
          "Best place to but t shirts and other souveniers. Only open thursday - sunday nights. Big stage with entertainment. 1 of my fave markets in phnom penh",
          "Really loved going to night market. It is not as hot as day market. Much more shops are open on the night. You have stands around market selling all kinds of goods.",
          "Great balance of clothing, wallets, bags etc. and food. At the back they had a really cool area where you could sit and eat. Very social and a fun, safe vibe. Would recommend.",
          "I won't bother going. Better off with certain tralee market or Russian market. Unless of course you want to kill some time.",
          "Small night market. Worth a quick look but nothing really interesting. Don't go out of your way to come here, good to walk to if it is nearby. Mostly catered to locals.",
          "Small market, mostly for locals judging by the sizes, am 38 inch waist and wouldn't get a belt to fit, food court is good fun though and PJ;s Pizza was very good",
          "We did a quick lap of this market. It's not bad but don't travel too far to see it as there isn't much there. Worth popping your head in to take a peek if you are in the area",
          "My tuk tuk drove me here for food, however I walked through the market in 15 minutes and opted for food at Riverside. If there was 20 food places, they all had the exact same dishes. What was quite nice though, was the mats, where families and friends can sit and eat",
          "Not bad although it has same food in every stall. Ambience is nice many locals and cheap food. To add there are plenty of cheap clothes.",
          "Went to the night market expecting to find clothes and souvenirs but found nothing. Bad quality stuff. Nevertheless there are a lot of food stands were you can buy and eat right there, in the floor.",
          "This place is a disappointment for me since I have been to several night and ready-to-wear markets. The goods being sold are a little bit expensive compared to Vietnam's and stalls pretty much clothes similar to each other. Modern clothing being sold look cheap. I wasn't able",
          "The night market attracts many locals who go there to eat and shop. There are lots of street stalls selling food which is cooked in front of you and then you can sit on the mats in the middle of the square. Lovely atmosphere whilst you eat.",
          "The night market is only open on weekends. Do try to come here for dinner at least once. In the evening, the food end of the market lays out rugs and carpets and you can order food there and take a seat on any one of the rugs. Literally, dining under the stars. A good",
          "Just regular night market, been to many other much better ones, specially in Vietnam. I you have time on your hands, then you can plan a visit.",
          "Small, only like t-shirts and watches to buy. Not much food either. Had some fried noodle with beef and it was good! If you are staying close you can get there to eat but if not - skip it.",
          "Love this place. Fun to bargain hunt. Lots of bbq, grilled sea food etc. Be careful some vendors, usually women get mad when you bargain. They usually quote 3 to 4 times.",
          "Things are pretty normal and just your normal night market. Clothes, performance and food. Clothes are pretty repetitive of what you will see at Ben Than market but cheaper . So - so .",
          "The night market is an intense experience, but definitely worth in. On the weekends it is jam-packed with people and food stalls. The food for offer is great, and locals and tourists enjoy it alike. There are also some good bargains on small souvenirs and clothes.",
          "The night market is a fun place to experience some culture. The stage and performers was entertaining to watch. And there is a huge variety of street food to choose from if your hungry. But my favorite part is weaving along the rows of business owners in each side selling",
          "I stumbled on Night Market food court on Saturday night, probably the busiest time of the week. It was full of people, locals (families) and foreigners (mostly young) some seated on colorful mats placed in the central space on the ground (shoes left off mat), some on small",
          "Able to find a few bargain tshirts and souvenirs. Refreshing shakes also. Lots of locals having dinner in the outdoor seating area.",
          "I plan to come to night market because I need to travel like local people. Many people here are local people but some little for foreigner. There is shopping block and food street. But many people here so you should beware your belonging.",
          "The night market is a small array of white tents, there are local stalls selling local food which you sit on mats on the floor to eat. The stalls are catered for the local population and not tourists. There are a lot of cheap clothes and shoes. It is not a place worth seeing.",
          "Not really worth visiting. There is not much to do, not much to see and not too much too eat either. The karaoke was truly bad.",
          "Nothing much to see compared to central market or Russian market. Pretty small night market with very limited choices. Always bargain.",
          "The hotel warned us of pick pockets, but even so, I ended up having my wallet stolen out of a pocket with a snap. A group of about 6 cambodians pressed up against me in a crowd and before I could break free, they had gotten my wallet. My wife also got bumped hard and found a",
          "I found these markets to be very relaxed - no-one grabbing and yelling. Yes, they try and convince you to buy (in the best tradition of markets) and they are happy to haggle for prices, but not too pushy. A lot of clothing is the same but walk around and check out the shows they",
          "Clothes, clothes and clothes. Maybe other things, but mainly clothes. Just normal clothes. Aside from that, nice spot to eat some typical food and hear some loud but interesting performances.",
          "Relatively small market offering snacks, clothing, flowers and local music. The market is set up in a circleIn the back there are straw mats on the ground for people",
          "The Market is only open from 5pm till midnight. There is good and cheap food. Fried noodles are only $1. There is live entertainment at night [local Khmer talent]. Great place to shop if you are looking for the following 1)Clothes 2)Footwear 3) Counterfeit watches. There aren't",
          "A nice little night market in PP that's worth a visit if you have time to kill before heading for food and drink along the quay to its south. Great food stalls that are yummy and cheap, so join in, get some food and sit with the locals.",
          "Phnom penh's night market is not particularly impressive and only has a small selection of tourist junk to choose from. The market is very small and the sellers are normally pretty fed up of the tourists haggling over a few cents and are not usually In a good mood. However there",
          "It's an ok place to meander around. Certainly wouldn't go out of my way to find it. You can find the things available for cheaper in the central market it seems, but the place has a nice buzz to it.",
          "We had nothing planned so we got in a Tuk Tuk to check out the night market. Let's put it like this - being there was like having nothing planned. Cheap replicas and food that would make you diet. Sorry!",
          "I saw exactly the same clothing and souvenirs in other night markets in Cambodia and Thailand. I mean, EXACTLY the same. There was this one dress with a banana print made of an unusual fabric that I remember having seen everywhere. Still, it was fun to go, wander around, people",
          "Went to this market on a Sunday evening. Many clothing and other stalls to look at and buy cheap goods. Also had an area at one end to purchase a range of Khmer food and sit on mats to eat. Worth a visit but not great.",
          "This market is situated over the road from the river and easy to get to and from. Has large stage and has entertainment as well as many shops selling clothes, food, gifts etc. there are many restaurants near by as well as many food vans. usually open Friday Saturday and Sunday",
          "The night market had very limited selection and was essentially a giant outdoor mall. If looking for a market with handmade goods and gifts, check out the Russian market. There was some entertainment going on up on a stage while we were there, a skit Or comedy routine and many",
          "We were a little disappointed with the night market. There were a lot stalls but mostly all were selling the same clothes, very limited selection. We were hoping to find a market with variety of different items but it just seemed to be clothes.",
          "Real Khmer food, lots of locals and tourists but very cute place to sit around on mats and indulge in Khmer food, balut included. A lot of clothes and other stores full of cheap merchandise. A must see.",
          "I've felt like back from to the past, people wore clothes like 15 years back, the music, the building, the area is in the middle of the market area, next to mekong river (black water's river) for food stall surrounding a big mat, place for you to eat on the street, joined other",
          "If the central market is over rated then this place should be avoided at all costs. Nothing new, smaller scale than central market but a total waste of time. Opened Wednesday to Sunday nowadays.",
          "Too many people for me. The market seems to be full of clothes and junk with hardly any room to walk between stalls. The best bit is the food stalls where you can pick up fried noodles and rice for less than a dollar.",
          "It was a nice place to walk around at night, and they had a Cambodian comedian up on stage, but I wouldn't go out of the way to visit it.",
          "We enjoyed wandering around the stalls but the highlight was the food. Delicious Indian and Khmer food, but the coconut ice-cream was some of the best I've tasted and believe me I've tasdted plenty",
          "If you're in the neighborhood, it could be worth a look but compared to the other markets in town, it's nothing special.",
          "... Give it 0 stars I would. This night market is horrible. They're trying to sell toys and that sort, more than souvies... The night market foods are pretty rank and unhygienic. I feel like I may get sick eating their foods here and this is coming from someone who tours food",
          "We walked around for less than 30 mins. There is nothing special to buy or to see...food is very street food. Items are very cheap but not nice at all.",
          "We ate at the stalls behind the live music stage at the Night Market. The clothing stalls etc are nothing special , but the food stalls were just fab. We had huge prawns, vegetables and noodles for less than $5 for 2 . There are rugs spread out in the square for you to sit and",
          "Same stalls selling the same stuff as each other every week. Cheap crap that for the most part doesn't work and is poorly made. It's not even that cheap. Compared with other markets of this nature around the world, this doesn't come close to being one I want to visit again, even",
          "I wouldn't say I'm Alan Whicker, but I have traveled around a bit and enjoy eating street food and visiting local Asian markets. This is rubbish. Some clothes stalls that you can find anywhere and a really poor food experience. The mats on the floor don't really do it for me and",
          "I LOVE Asian markets but this one is a complete waste of time. Large part of the market is taken by a stage with locals singing karaoke so expect some blasting Cambodian pop songs. Like some other reviews said, all the food vendors sell exactly the same thing and it looks",
          "Came here thinking the variety would be much more. Took a wander and to find most of the stuff is clothes geared towards the locals. Still nice to wander. At the end was a stage with a woman singing. She sounded like a female cat. Russian markets is better. If coming from SS buy",
          "Spent about 10 minutes here and wanted to leave. I've eaten a lot of street food while traveling (I love street food!) and most of them looked clean enough to eat but this night market had the dirtiest food! Flies and other huge bugs were standing on most of the food and it",
          "We stopped over here to change bus going to Siem Reap. Killed time by roaming around the small complex. It was just like any night market except the food section. Instead of chairs and tables they have woven mats spread on the floor. We crossed our legs and enjoyed our meal with",
          "Interesting place to visit but very crowded. Better bargains at the Central Market. Has a nice stage and saw some local talent.",
          "Go ounce just to see but after 5min its enought, good if you want to buy some tshirts (2/3$). Food was all the same, seems like the street food is better on the side streets around the market",
          "We visited here the 6th December after we had been on a sunset dinner/cocktail cruise as it was just over the road from where we got off the boat. It was quite busy by the time we got there, it was alright but nothing special, very noisy with loud music and lots of locals, would",
          "This market is focused on clothing, not so much on souvenirs. And also it is relatively small. Sellers seem bored.",
          "Great streetfood! And cheap. Some shopping poss for clothes, shoes, watches and other stuff but we went for the great streetfood. For 2 to 4 dollar you have a great meal!",
          "Cheap street food and concerts every day. Also, it has a small market with affordable clothes and accessories. If you just arrived in Phnom Penh this place can show you original Asian life,",
          "Visited this night market as not far from the hotel and although the stalls offered nothing new compared to the Russian and Central markets, the food section was good and we had a delicious self-selection of snacks with a bowl of noodle soup for $4 each.",
          "It is OK but not very extensive. We bought some clothing and a leather belt. Not as good as the Central market, but I found that late at night they were more willing to bargain.",
          "The market is ok, nice to see at night and take cheap souvenirs Many people, many times you ve singers ( cambodian bands ) or theather, Good to visit.",

          "Stopped by here as love a night market, but it was very small and there was really only clothes on sale (the same ones as you get everywhere else). The street food stalls looked really good and the selection was impressive and smelt amazing, so would mainly recommend for that.",
          "as a night market I found it very plain and boring, also VERY small...but then you have a really cool part where you can get all sorts of food and sweets...I tried the fried oreo...amazing XD so I would reccomend it for that reason, get your dinner, grab a beer and just lay down",
          "It is a market which opens at 5pm. Sometimes there is a band, very little handicrafts. Probably great if it is your first night in PP, but I never bring my guests there. No deals to be made, all is cheap bling bling.",

          "It's a busy street but compared to other ones in Asia it's considered less crowded and easy to walk around, as there aren't many streets that cross along the shopping area, walk up and down most of the shops are selling the same. If you are buying a hammek I would recommend you",
          "This is a smaller market and I was looking forward to leisurely wander around. I did for the first half an hour and then disaster strike. Never felt a thing to start with then turned around and my back pack had been opened both top zip and purse taken and main zip open. Nothing",

          "Doesn't really compare on scale with some of the other night markets in SE Asia, but you might as well take a look round. Most of it is clothing with the odd souvenir / jewellery stall. Was very busy when we went, keep an eye on your possessions.",
          "We went to the night market at about 6:30pm just after the sun had set. There was many stalls but almost all of them where women's clothes. You do need to fight your way through the crowds but it is less hectic than the Russian market. Enjoy !",

          "This market is a little small compared to others in SE Asia, but I had a really good time here nonetheless. I'm not much of a shopper, but my girlfriend loves to shop and had a good time searching around for some good bargains on clothes. I was able to occupy myself with some",

          "I found the night market in Phnom Penh particularly interesting to blend with the locals and have some nice street food. A big food arena is set up and there are more locals then foreigners, the food is cheap and tasty. I would recommend to stop by one evening!",

          "If you want to rub shoulders with the locals this is the place to be. It is crowded and you are shoulder to shoulder all the time. You will not see any foreigners all the time you are there. Why tourists miss out on this experience I do not know. There are plenty of clothing",

          "This market is situated in a central area, in walking distance from the King's Palace and next to the promenade. It offers a rich choice of cheap textile items, jewelry and souvenirs. The night market is worth visiting even if you don't plan shopping, just for the ambiance.",

          "Come for the food only. There are stands that sell trinkets and clothing. Limited variety - mostly bags, watches, shoes, clothing. \n\nThere is a stage with performers at night. Food court area is neat with floor picnic style seating. Most \u2026",

          "For a foreigner there's not much to see or do except eat at the food court. The cool part is the rugs spread on the ground where you sit to eat. Phnom Penh is extremely hot, maybe that's why market is at night. Enjoy",
          "Nice experience of sitting on the ground, having street foods",
          "Good place to chill and eat street foods like barbeque and noddles...  You can buy some Cambodian clothes as well",

          "Perfect place to spend night times",

          "Many things for food. I do not know if it's healthy or not.",
          "Just as the name implied, it's a night market. The place is not that crowded but it still is very alive and there are live concerts performing there every weekend, I believe.

        "wiki": "Norodom Sihanouk (Khmer: \u1793\u179a\u17c4\u178f\u17d2\u178f\u1798 \u179f\u17b8\u17a0\u1793\u17bb; 31 October 1922 \u2013 15 October 2012) was head of state of Cambodia numerous times. In Cambodia, he is known as Samdech Euv (Khmer: \u179f\u1798\u17d2\u178f\u17c1\u1785\u17aa, father prince). During his lifetime Cambodia was variously called the French Protectorate of Cambodia (until 1953), the Kingdom of Cambodia (1953\u201370), the Khmer Republic (1970\u201375), Democratic Kampuchea (1975\u201379), the People's Republic of Kampuchea (1979\u201393), and again the Kingdom of Cambodia (from 1993).\nSihanouk became king of Cambodia in 1941 upon the death of his maternal grandfather, King Monivong. After the Japanese occupation of Cambodia during the Second World War, he secured Cambodian independence from France. He abdicated in 1955 and was succeeded by his father, Suramarit. Sihanouk's political organization Sangkum won the general elections that year and he became prime minister of Cambodia. He governed it under one-party rule, suppressed political dissent, and declared himself Head of State in 1960. Officially neutral in foreign relations, in practice he was closer to the communist bloc. The Cambodian coup of 1970 ousted him and he fled to China and North Korea, there forming a government-in-exile and resistance movement. He encouraged Cambodians to fight the new government and backed the Khmer Rouge during the Cambodian Civil War. He returned as figurehead head of state after the Khmer Rouge's victory in 1975. His relations with the new government declined and in 1976 he resigned. He was placed under house arrest until Vietnamese forces overthrew the Khmer Rouge in 1979.\nSihanouk went into exile again and in 1981 formed FUNCINPEC, a resistance party. The following year, he became president of the Coalition Government of Democratic Kampuchea (CGDK), a broad coalition of anti-Vietnamese resistance factions which retained Cambodia's seat at the United Nations, making him Cambodia's internationally recognized head of state. In the late 1980s, informal talks were carried out to end hostilities between the Vietnam-supported People's Republic of Kampuchea and the CGDK. In 1990, the Supreme National Council of Cambodia was formed as a transitional body to oversee Cambodia's sovereign matters, with Sihanouk as its president. The 1991 Paris Peace Accords were signed and the United Nations Transitional Authority in Cambodia (UNTAC) was established the following year. The UNTAC organized the 1993 Cambodian general elections, and a coalition government, jointly led by his son Norodom Ranariddh and Hun Sen, was subsequently formed. He was reinstated as Cambodia's king. He abdicated again in 2004 and the Royal Council of the Throne chose his son, Sihamoni, as his successor. Sihanouk died in Beijing in 2012.\nBetween 1941 and 2006, Sihanouk produced and directed 50 films, some of which he acted in. The films, later described as being of low quality, often featured nationalistic elements, as did a number of the songs he wrote. Some of his songs were about his wife Queen Monique, the nations neighboring Cambodia, and the communist leaders who supported him in his exile. In the 1980s Sihanouk held concerts for diplomats in New York City. He also participated in concerts at his palace during his second reign.\n\n\n== Early life and first reign ==\n\nNorodom Sihanouk was the only child born of the union between Norodom Suramarit and Sisowath Kossamak. His parents, who heeded the Royal Court Astrologer's advice that he risked dying at a young age if he was raised under parental care, placed him under the care of Kossamak's grandmother, Pat. When Pat died, Kossamak brought Sihanouk to live with his paternal grandfather, Norodom Sutharot. Sutharot delegated parenting responsibilities to his daughter, Norodom Ket Kanyamom. Sihanouk received his primary education at the Fran\u00e7ois Baudoin school and Nuon Moniram school in Phnom Penh. During this time, he received financial support from his maternal grandfather, Sisowath Monivong, to head an amateur performance troupe and soccer team. In 1936, Sihanouk was sent to Saigon, where he pursued his secondary education at Lyc\u00e9e Chasseloup Laubat, a boarding school.When the reigning king Monivong died on 23 April 1941 the Governor-General of French Indochina, Jean Decoux, chose Sihanouk to succeed him. Sihanouk's appointment as king was formalised the following day by the Cambodian Crown Council, and his coronation ceremony took place on 3 May 1941. During the Japanese occupation of Cambodia, he dedicated most of his time to sports, filming, and the occasional tour to the countryside. In March 1945 the Japanese military, which had occupied Cambodia since August 1941, dissolved the nominal French colonial administration. Under pressure from the Japanese, Sihanouk proclaimed Cambodia's independence and assumed the position of prime minister while serving as king at the same time.As prime minister, Sihanouk revoked a decree issued by the last resident superior of Cambodia, Georges Gautier, to romanise the Khmer alphabet. Following the Surrender of Japan in August 1945, nationalist forces loyal to Son Ngoc Thanh launched a coup, which led to Thanh becoming prime minister. When the French returned to Cambodia in October 1945, Thanh was dismissed and replaced by Sihanouk's uncle Sisowath Monireth. Monireth negotiated for greater autonomy in managing Cambodia's internal affairs. A modus vivendi signed in January 1946 granted Cambodia autonomy within the French Union. A joint French-Cambodian commission was set up after that to draft Cambodia's constitution, and in April 1946 Sihanouk introduced clauses which provided for an elected parliament on the basis of universal male suffrage as well as press freedom. The first constitution was signed into effect by Sihanouk in May 1947. Around this time, Sihanouk made two trips to Saumur, France, where he attended military training at the Armoured Cavalry Branch Training School in 1946, and again in 1948. He was made a reserve captain in the French army.In early 1949, Sihanouk traveled to Paris with his parents to negotiate with the French government for more autonomy for Cambodia. The modus vivendi was replaced by a new Franco-Khmer treaty, which recognised Cambodia as \"independent\" within the French Union. In practice, the treaty granted only limited self-rule to Cambodia. While Cambodia was given free rein in managing its foreign ministry and, to a lesser extent, its defence, most of the other ministries remained under French control. Meanwhile, dissenting legislators from the national assembly attacked the government led by prime minister Penn Nouth over its failure to resolve deepening financial and corruption problems plaguing the country. The dissenting legislators, led by Yem Sambaur, who had defected from the Democrat party in November 1948, deposed Penn Nouth. Yem Sambaur replaced him, but his appointment did not sit well with the Democrats, who in turn pressured Sihanouk to dissolve the national assembly and hold elections.\n\nSihanouk, who by now had tired of the political squabbling, dissolved the assembly in September 1949, but opted to rule by decree for the next two years before general elections were held, which the Democrats won. In October 1951, Thanh returned to Cambodia and was received by 100,000 supporters, a spectacle which Sihanouk saw as an affront to his regal authority. Thanh disappeared six months later, presumably to join the Khmer Issarak. Sihanouk ordered the Democrat-led government to arrest Thanh but was ignored. Subsequently, civil demonstrations against the monarchy and the French broke out in the countryside, alarming Sihanouk, who began to suspect that the Democrats were complicit. In June 1952 Sihanouk dismissed the Democrat nominee Huy Kanthoul and made himself prime minister. A few days later, Sihanouk privately confided in exasperation to the US charg\u00e9 d'affaires, Thomas Gardiner Corcoran, that parliamentary democracy was unsuitable for Cambodia.In January 1952, Sihanouk re-appointed Penn Nouth as prime minister before leaving for France. Once there, Sihanouk wrote to French President Vincent Auriol requesting that he grant Cambodia full independence, citing widespread anti-French sentiment among the Cambodian populace. Auriol deferred Sihanouk's request to the French Commissioner for Overseas Territories, Jean Letourneau, who promptly rejected it. Subsequently, Sihanouk traveled to Canada and the United States, where he gave radio interviews to present his case. He took advantage of the prevailing anti-communist sentiment in those countries, arguing that Cambodia faced a Communist threat similar to that of the Viet Minh in Vietnam, and that the solution was to grant full independence to Cambodia. Sihanouk returned to Cambodia in June 1953, taking up residence in Siem Reap. He organised public rallies calling for Cambodians to fight for independence, and formed a citizenry militia which attracted about 130,000 recruits.In August 1953, France agreed to cede control over judicial and interior affairs to Cambodia, and  in October 1953 the defense ministry as well. At the end of October, Sihanouk went to Phnom Penh, where he declared Cambodia's independence from France on 9 November 1953. In May 1954, Sihanouk sent two of his cabinet ministers, Nhiek Tioulong and Tep Phan, to represent Cambodia at the Geneva Conference. The agreements  affirmed Cambodia's independence and allowed it to seek military aid from any country without restrictions. At the same time, Sihanouk's relations with the governing Democrat party remained strained, as they were wary of his growing political influence. To counter Democrat opposition, Sihanouk held a national referendum to gauge public approval for his efforts to seek national independence. While the results showed 99.8 percent approval, Australian historian Milton Osborne noted that open balloting was carried out and voters were cowed into casting an approval vote under police surveillance.\n\n\n== Sangkum era ==\n\n\n=== Abdication and entry into politics ===\nOn 2 March 1955, Sihanouk abdicated the throne and was in turn succeeded by his father, Suramarit. In his abdication speech, Sihanouk explained that he was abdicating in order to extricate himself from the \"intrigues\" of palace life and allow easier access to common folk as an \"ordinary citizen\". According to Osborne, Sihanouk's abdication earned him the freedom to pursue politics while continuing to enjoy the deference that he had received from his subjects when he was king.In April 1955, Sihanouk formed his own political party, the Sangkum, and expressed interest in competing in the general elections slated to be held in September 1955. While the Sangkum was, in effect, a political party, Sihanouk argued that the Sangkum should be seen as a political \"organisation\", and explained that he could accommodate people with differing political orientations on the sole condition that they pledged fealty to the monarchy.Sangkum was based on four small, monarchist, rightist parties, including the 'Victorious North-East' party of Dap Chhuon, the Khmer Renovation party of Lon Nol, the People's Party and the Liberal Party. At the same time, Sihanouk was running out of patience with the increasingly leftist Democratic Party and the left-wing Pracheachon, as both had refused to merge into his party and had campaigned against him. He appointed as director of national security Dap Chhuon, who ordered the national police to jail their leaders and break up their election rallies. When elections were held, the Sangkum received 83 percent of all valid votes. They took up all seats in the National Assembly, replacing the Democrats, which had until then been the majority party. The following month, Sihanouk was appointed as prime minister.\n\n\n=== Premiership (1955\u201360) ===\n\nOnce in office, Sihanouk introduced several constitutional changes, including extending suffrage to women, adopting Khmer as the sole official language of the country and making Cambodia a constitutional monarchy by vesting policy-making powers in the prime minister rather than the king. He viewed socialism as an ideal concept for establishing social equality and fostering national cohesion within newly independent Cambodia. In March 1956, he embarked on a national programme of \"Buddhist socialism\", promoting socialist principles on the one hand while maintaining the kingdom's Buddhist culture on the other. Between 1955 and 1960, Sihanouk resigned and retook the post of prime minister several times, citing fatigue caused by overwork. The National Assembly nominated experienced politicians such as Sim Var and San Yun to become prime minister whenever Sihanouk took leave, but they similarly relinquished their posts each time, several months into their term, as cabinet ministers repeatedly disagreed over public policy matters.In May 1955, Sihanouk had accepted military aid from the US. The following January, when he was in the Philippines on a state visit, Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) operatives attempted to sway him into placing Cambodia under Southeast Asia Treaty Organization (SEATO) protection. Subsequently, Sihanouk began to suspect that the US was attempting to undermine his government and that it was lending covert support to the Democratic party, now without parliamentary representation, for that purpose. On the other hand, Sihanouk developed a good impression of China, whose premier, Zhou Enlai, gave him a warm reception on his first visit there in February 1956. They signed a friendship treaty in which China promised US$40 million in economic aid to Cambodia. When Sihanouk returned from China, Sarit Thanarat and Ngo Dinh Diem, leaders of Thailand and South Vietnam, respectively, both with pro-American sympathies, started to accuse him of pro-Communist sympathies. South Vietnam briefly imposed a trade embargo on Cambodia, preventing trading ships from travelling up the Mekong river to Phnom Penh. While Sihanouk professed that he was pursuing a policy of neutrality, Sarit and Diem remained distrustful of him, more so after he established formal diplomatic relations with China in 1958.The Democratic party continued to criticize the Sangkum and Sihanouk in their newspaper, much to Sihanouk's consternation. In August 1957 Sihanouk finally lost patience, calling out Democrat leaders for a debate. Five of them attended. At the debate, held at the royal palace, Sihanouk spoke in a belligerent tone, challenging the Democrat leaders to present evidence of malfeasance in his government and inviting them to join the Sangkum. The Democrat leaders gave hesitant responses, and, according to American historian David P. Chandler, this gave the audience the impression that they were disloyal to the monarchy. The debate led to the effective demise of the Democratic party, as its leaders were subsequently beaten up by government soldiers, with Sihanouk's tacit approval. With the Democrats vanquished, Sihanouk focused on preparing for general elections, slated to be held in March 1958. He drafted left-wing politicians, including Hou Yuon, Hu Nim and Chau Seng, to stand as Sangkum candidates, with a view to winning left-wing support from the Pracheachon. The Pracheachon on their part fielded five candidates for the elections. However, four of them withdrew, as they were prevented by the national police from holding any election rallies. When voting took place, the Sangkum won all seats in the national assembly.In December 1958 Ngo Dinh Nhu, Diem's younger brother and chief adviser, broached the idea of orchestrating a coup to overthrow Sihanouk. Nhu contacted Dap Chhuon, Sihanouk's Interior Minister, who was known for his pro-American sympathies, to prepare for the coup against his boss. Chhuon received covert financial and military assistance from Thailand, South Vietnam, and the CIA. In January 1959 Sihanouk learned of the coup plans through intermediaries who were in contact with Chhuon. The following month, Sihanouk sent the army to capture Chhuon, who was summarily executed as soon as he was captured, effectively ending the coup attempt. Sihanouk then accused South Vietnam and the United States of orchestrating the coup attempt. Six months later, on 31 August 1959, a small packaged lacquer gift fitted with a parcel bomb was delivered to the royal palace. Norodom Vakrivan, the chief of protocol, was killed instantly when he opened the package. Sihanouk's parents, Suramarit and Kossamak, were sitting in another room not far from Vakrivan. An investigation traced the origin of the parcel bomb to an American military base in Saigon. While Sihanouk publicly accused Ngo Dinh Nhu of masterminding the bomb attack, he secretly suspected that the US was also involved. The incident deepened his distrust of the US.\n\n\n=== Initial years as Head of State (1960\u201365) ===\nSuramarit, Sihanouk's father, died on 3 April 1960 after several months of poor health that Sihanouk blamed upon the shock that his father had received from the parcel bomb attack. The following day, the Cambodian Crown Council met to choose Monireth as regent. Over the next two months, Sihanouk introduced constitutional amendments to create the new post of Head of State of Cambodia, which provided ceremonial powers equivalent to that of the king. A referendum held on 5 June 1960 approved Sihanouk's proposals, and Sihanouk was formally appointed Head of State on 14 June 1960. As the head of state, Sihanouk took over various ceremonial responsibilities of the king, such as holding public audiences and leading the Royal Ploughing Ceremony. At the same time, he continued to play an active role in politics as Sangkum's leader.\n\nIn 1961 Pracheachon's spokesperson, Non Suon, criticized Sihanouk for failing to tackle inflation, unemployment, and corruption in the country. Non Suon's criticisms gave Sihanouk the impetus to arrest Pracheachon leaders, and, according to him, he had discovered plans by their party to monitor local political developments on behalf of foreign powers. In May 1962 Tou Samouth, Pracheachon's secretary-general, disappeared, and its ideological ally, the Communist Party of Kampuchea, suspected that Samouth had been secretly captured and killed by police. Sihanouk nevertheless allowed Sangkum's left-wing politicians to run again in the 1962 general elections, which they all won. He even appointed two left-wing politicians, Hou Yuon and Khieu Samphan, as secretaries for planning and commerce, respectively, after the election.In November 1962, Sihanouk called on the US to stop supporting the Khmer Serei, which he believed they had been secretly doing through the CIA. He threatened to reject all economic aid from the US if they failed to respond to his demands, a threat he later carried out on 19 November 1963. At the same time, Sihanouk also nationalised the country's entrepot trade, banking sector, and distillery industries. To oversee policy and regulatory matters on the country's entrepot trade, he set up the National Export-Import Corporation and Statutory Board, better known as \"SONEXIM\". When Sarit, Diem, and US president John F. Kennedy died in November and December 1963, Sihanouk rejoiced over their deaths, as he accused them of attempting to destabilise Cambodia. He organised concerts and granted civil servants extra leave time to celebrate the occasion. When the US government protested Sihanouk's celebrations, he responded by recalling the Cambodian ambassador to the US, Nong Kimny.In early 1964, Sihanouk signed a secret agreement with North Vietnam and the Viet Cong, allowing Chinese military aid meant for them to be delivered through Sihanoukville's port. In turn, the Cambodian army would be paid for delivering food supplies to the Viet Cong, and at the same time skim off 10 percent of all military hardware supplies. In addition, he also allowed the Viet Cong to build a trail through eastern Cambodia, so that their troops could receive war supplies from North Vietnam. The trail later became known as the Sihanouk Trail. When the US learned of Viet Cong presence in eastern Cambodia, they started a bombing campaign, spurring Sihanouk to sever diplomatic ties with the US in May 1965. As a result of this secret agreement, Communist countries, including China, the Soviet Union, and Czechoslovakia, provided military aid to Cambodia.\n\n\n=== Continued leadership as Head of State (1966\u201370) ===\n\nIn September 1966, general elections were held, and Sangkum legislators with conservative and right-wing sympathies dominated the national assembly. In turn, they nominated Lon Nol, a military general who shared their political sympathies, as prime minister. However, their choice did not sit well with Sihanouk. To counterbalance conservative and right-wing influence, in October 1966 Sihanouk set up a shadow government made up of Sangkum legislators with left-wing sympathies. At the end of the month, Lon Nol offered to resign from his position, but was ironically stopped from doing so by Sihanouk. In April 1967, the Samlaut Uprising occurred, with local peasants fighting against government troops in Samlaut, Battambang. As soon as government troops managed to quell the fighting, Sihanouk began to suspect that three left-wing Sangkum legislators \u2013 Khieu Samphan, Hou Yuon and Hu Nim \u2013 had incited the rebellion. When Sihanouk threatened to charge Khieu Samphan and Hou Yuon before a military tribunal, they fled into the jungle to join the Khmer Rouge, leaving Hu Nim behind.Lon Nol resigned as prime minister in early May 1967, and Sihanouk appointed Son Sann in his place. At the same time, Sihanouk replaced conservative-leaning ministers appointed by Lon Nol with technocrats and left-leaning politicians. In the later part of the month, after receiving news that the Chinese embassy in Cambodia had published and distributed Communist propaganda to the Cambodian populace praising the Cultural Revolution, Sihanouk accused China of supporting local Chinese Cambodians in engaging in \"contraband\" and \"subversive\" activities. In August 1967, Sihanouk sent to China his Foreign Minister, Norodom Phurissara, who unsuccessfully urged Zhou to stop the Chinese embassy from disseminating Communist propaganda. In response, Sihanouk closed the Cambodia\u2013Chinese Friendship Association in September 1967. When the Chinese government protested, Sihanouk threatened to close the Chinese embassy in Cambodia. Zhou stepped in to placate Sihanouk, and compromised by instructing its embassy to send its publications to Cambodia's information ministry for vetting prior to distribution.As relations with China worsened, Sihanouk pursued rapprochement with the US. He learned that Kennedy's widow, Jacqueline Kennedy, had expressed a desire to see Angkor Wat. Seeing this as an opportunity to restore relations with the US, Sihanouk invited her to visit Cambodia and personally hosted her visit in October 1967. Jacqueline Kennedy's visit paved the way for Sihanouk to meet with Chester Bowles, the US ambassador to India. To Bowles, Sihanouk expressed his willingness to restore bilateral relations with the US, hinted at the presence of Viet Cong troops in Cambodia, and suggested he would turn a blind eye should US forces enter Cambodia to attack Viet Cong troops retreating into Cambodia from South Vietnam\u2014a practice known as \"hot pursuit\"\u2014provided that Cambodians were unharmed. Kenton Clymer notes that this statement \"cannot reasonably be construed to mean that Sihanouk approved of the intensive, ongoing B-52 bombing raids\" the US launched in eastern Cambodia beginning in March 1969 as part of Operation Menu, adding: \"In any event, no one asked him. ... Sihanouk was never asked to approve the B-52 bombings, and he never gave his approval.\" The bombing forced the Viet Cong to flee from their jungle sanctuaries and seek refuge in populated towns and villages. As a result, Sihanouk became concerned that Cambodia might get drawn into fighting in the Vietnam War. In June 1969, he extended diplomatic recognition to the Provisional Revolutionary Government of the Republic of South Vietnam (PRGSV), hoping that he could get the Viet Cong troops under its charge to leave Cambodia should they win the war. At the same time, he also openly admitted the presence of Viet Cong troops in Cambodia for the first time, prompting the US to restore formal diplomatic relations with Cambodia three months later.As the Cambodian economy was stagnating due to systemic corruption, Sihanouk opened two casinos \u2013 in Phnom Penh and Sihanoukville \u2013 in January 1969. While the casinos satisfied his aim of generating state revenues of up to 700 million riels in that year, it also caused a sharp increase in the number of bankruptcies and suicides. In August 1969 Lon Nol was reappointed as Prime Minister, with Sisowath Sirik Matak as his deputy. Two months later, Lon Nol left Cambodia to seek medical treatment, leaving Sirik Matak to run the government. Between October and December 1969, Sirik Matak instituted several policy changes that ran contrary to Sihanouk's wishes, such as allowing private banks to re-open in the country and devaluing the riel. He also encouraged ambassadors to write to Lon Nol directly, instead of going through Sihanouk, angering the latter. In early January 1970, Sihanouk left Cambodia for medical treatment in France. Shortly after he left, Sirik Matak took the opportunity to close down the casinos.\n\n\n== Deposition, GRUNK and Khmer Rouge years ==\n\nOn 11 March 1970, a large protest took place outside the North Vietnamese and PRGSV embassies, as protesters demanded Viet Cong troops withdraw from Cambodia. The protests turned chaotic, as protesters looted both embassies and set them on fire, alarming Sihanouk. Sihanouk, who was in Paris at the time, considered both returning to quell the protests and visiting Moscow, Beijing, and Hanoi. He opted for the latter, thinking that he could persuade its leaders to recall Viet Cong troops to their jungle sanctuaries, where they had originally established themselves between 1964 and 1969. Five days later, Oum Mannorine, the half-brother of Sihanouk's wife Monique, was summoned to the National Assembly to answer corruption charges. On that night after the hearing, Mannorine ordered troops under his command to arrest Lon Nol and Sirik Matak, but ended up getting arrested by Lon Nol's troops instead. On 18 March 1970 the National Assembly voted to depose Sihanouk, allowing Lon Nol to assume emergency powers.\n\nOn that day, Sihanouk was in Moscow meeting Soviet foreign minister Alexei Kosygin, who broke the news to him. From Moscow, Sihanouk flew to Beijing, where he was received by Zhou. Zhou arranged for the North Vietnamese Prime Minister, Pham Van Dong to fly to Beijing from Hanoi and meet with Sihanouk. Both Zhou and Dong encouraged Sihanouk to rebel against Lon Nol and promised him military and financial support. On 23 March 1970, Sihanouk announced the formation of his resistance movement, the National United Front of Kampuchea (FUNK). He encouraged the Cambodian populace to join him and fight against Lon Nol's government. Khmer Rouge soldiers broadcast Sihanouk's message in the Cambodian countryside, which roused demonstrations rooting for his cause that were brutally suppressed by Lon Nol's troops. Sometime later, on 5 May 1970, Sihanouk announced the formation of a government-in-exile known as the Royal Government of the National Union of Kampuchea (GRUNK), leading Communist countries including China, North Vietnam, and North Korea to break relations with the Lon Nol regime. In Phnom Penh, a military trial convened on 2 July 1970, whereby Sihanouk was charged with treason and corruption in his capacity as Head of State. After a three-day trial, the judges ruled Sihanouk guilty of both charges and sentenced to him death in absentia on 5 July 1970.Between 1970 and 1975, Sihanouk took up residence in state guesthouses at Beijing and Pyongyang, courtesy of the Chinese and North Korean governments, respectively. In February 1973, Sihanouk traveled to Hanoi, where he started on a long journey with Khieu Samphan and other Khmer Rouge leaders. The convoy proceeded along the Ho Chi Minh trail and reached the Cambodian border at Stung Treng Province the following month. From there, they traveled across the provinces of Stung Treng, Preah Vihear, and Siem Reap. Throughout this entire leg of the journey, Sihanouk faced constant bombardment from American planes participating in Operation Freedom Deal. At Siem Reap, Sihanouk visited the temples of Angkor Wat, Banteay Srei, and Bayon. In August 1973, Sirik Matak wrote an open letter calling on Sihanouk to bring the Cambodian Civil War to an end and suggesting the possibility of his return to the country. When the letter reached Sihanouk, he angrily rejected Sirik Matak's entreaties.After the Khmer Republic fell to the Khmer Rouge on 17 April 1975, a new regime under its charge, Democratic Kampuchea, was formed. Sihanouk was appointed as its Head of State, a ceremonial position. In September 1975, Sihanouk briefly returned to Cambodia to inter the ashes of his mother, before going abroad again to lobby for diplomatic recognition of Democratic Kampuchea. He returned on 31 December 1975 and presided over a meeting to endorse the constitution of Democratic Kampuchea. In February 1976, Khieu Samphan took him on a tour across the Cambodian countryside. Sihanouk was shocked to see the use of forced labour and population displacement carried out by the Khmer Rouge government, known as the Angkar. Following the tour, Sihanouk decided to resign as the Head of State. The Angkar initially rejected his resignation request, though they subsequently accepted it in mid-April 1976, retroactively backdating it to 2 April 1976.From this point onwards Sihanouk was kept under house arrest at the royal palace. In September 1978, he was removed to another apartment in Phnom Penh's suburbs, where he lived until the end of the year. Throughout his confinement, Sihanouk made several unsuccessful requests to the Angkar to travel overseas. Vietnam invaded Cambodia on 22 December 1978. On 1 January 1979, Sihanouk was taken from Phnom Penh to Sisophon, where he stayed for three days until 5 January, when he was taken back to Phnom Penh. Sihanouk was taken to meet Pol Pot, who briefed him on the Angkar's plans to repulse Vietnamese troops. On 6 January 1979, Sihanouk was allowed to fly to Beijing from Phnom Penh, where he was greeted by Zhou Enlai's successor, Deng Xiaoping. The next day Phnom Penh fell to advancing Vietnamese troops on 7 January 1979. On 9 January 1979, Sihanouk flew from Beijing to New York to attend the UN Security Council, where he simultaneously condemned the Khmer Rouge for orchestrating the Cambodian genocide as well as the Vietnamese occupation of Cambodia. Sihanouk subsequently sought asylum in China after making two unsuccessful asylum applications with the US and France.\n\n\n== FUNCINPEC and CGDK years ==\n\nAfter the Khmer Rouge regime was overthrown, a new Cambodian government supported by Vietnam, the People's Republic of Kampuchea (PRK), was established. The Chinese leader, Deng Xiaoping, was unhappy with Vietnam's influence over the PRK government. Deng proposed to Sihanouk that he co-operate with the Khmer Rouge to overthrow the PRK government, but the latter rejected it, as he opposed the genocidal policies pursued by the Khmer Rouge while they were in power. In March 1981, Sihanouk established a resistance movement, FUNCINPEC which was complemented by a small resistance army known as Arm\u00e9e Nationale Sihanoukiste (ANS). He appointed In Tam, who had briefly served as Prime Minister in the Khmer Republic, as the commander-in-chief of ANS. The ANS needed military aid from China, and Deng seized the opportunity to sway Sihanouk into collaborating with the Khmer Rouge. Sihanouk reluctantly agreed, and started talks in March 1981 with the Khmer Rouge and the Son Sann-led Khmer People's National Liberation Front (KPNLF) on a unified anti-PRK resistance movement.After several rounds of negotiations mediated by Deng and Singapore's prime minister Lee Kuan Yew, FUNCINPEC, KPNLF, and the Khmer Rouge agreed to form the Coalition Government of Democratic Kampuchea (CGDK) in June 1982. The CGDK was headed by Sihanouk, and functioned as a government-in-exile. The UN defeated a resolution to expel Democratic Kampuchea and admit the PRK, effectively confirming Sihanouk as Cambodia's internationally recognized head of state.As CGDK chairperson, Sihanouk unsuccessfully negotiated, over the next five years, with the Chinese government to broker a political settlement to end the Vietnamese occupation of Cambodia. During this period, Sihanouk appointed two of his sons, Norodom Chakrapong and Norodom Ranariddh, to lead the ANS. Chakrapong was appointed as the deputy chief-of-staff for the ANS in March 1985, while Ranariddh was minted to the twin positions of commander-in-chief and the chief-of-staff of the ANS in January 1986, replacing Tam. In December 1987, the Prime Minister of the PRK government, Hun Sen, first met with Sihanouk to discuss ending the protracted Cambodian\u2013Vietnamese War. The following July, the then-foreign minister of Indonesia, Ali Alatas, brokered the first round of meetings between the four warring Cambodian factions consisting of FUNCINPEC, Khmer Rouge, KPNLF, and the PRK government over the future of Cambodia. Two more rounds of meetings were held in February and May 1989; since all were held near Jakarta, they became known as the Jakarta Informal Meetings (JIM).In July 1989, Ali Alatas joined French foreign minister Roland Dumas in opening the Paris Peace Conference, where discussions took place regarding plans for Vietnamese troop withdrawal and power-sharing arrangements in a hypothetical future Cambodian government. The following month, Sihanouk resigned as president of FUNCINPEC but remained in the party as an ordinary member. In September 1990, the United Nations (UN) sponsored the establishment of the Supreme National Council of Cambodia (SNC), an administrative body responsible for overseeing the sovereign affairs of Cambodia for an interim period until UN-sponsored elections were held. The creation of the SNC was subsequently ratified with United Nations Security Council Resolution 668. In July 1991 Sihanouk left FUNCINPEC altogether and was elected as the chairperson of the SNC.\n\n\n== UNTAC administration era ==\nOn 23 October 1991, Sihanouk led the FUNCINPEC, Khmer Rouge, KPNLF, and PRK into signing the Paris Peace Accords. The accords recognised the SNC as a \"legitimate representative of Cambodian sovereignty\" and created the United Nations Transitional Authority in Cambodia (UNTAC) to serve as a transitional government between 1992 and 1993. In turn, UNTAC was given the mandate to station peacekeeping troops in Cambodia to supervise the disarmament of troops from the four warring Cambodian factions and to carry out national elections by 1993. Sihanouk subsequently returned to Phnom Penh on 14 November 1991. Together with Hun Sen, Sihanouk rode in an open top limousine from Pochentong Airport all the way to the royal palace, greeting city residents who lined the streets to welcome his return. The UNTAC administration was set up in February 1992, but stumbled in its peacekeeping operations as the Khmer Rouge refused to cooperate in disarmament. In response, Sihanouk urged UNTAC to abandon the Khmer Rouge from the peacekeeping process on two occasions, in July and September 1992. During this period, Sihanouk mostly resided in Siem Reap and occasionally traveled by helicopter to supervise election preparations in KPNLF, FUNCINPEC, and Khmer Rouge resistance bases.Sihanouk left in November 1992 to seek medical treatment in Beijing, where he stayed for the next six months until his return to Cambodia in May 1993, on the eve of elections. While in Beijing, Sihanouk proposed a Presidential system government for Cambodia to then-UN secretary-general Boutros Boutros-Ghali, but soon dropped the idea after facing opposition from the Khmer Rouge. When general elections were held, FUNCINPEC, now headed by Sihanouk's son Norodom Ranariddh, won, while the Cambodian People's Party (CPP) headed by Hun Sen came in second. The CPP was unhappy with the election results, and on 3 June 1993 Hun Sen and Chea Sim called on Sihanouk to lead the government. Sihanouk complied, and announced the formation of a Provisional National Government (PRG) headed by him, with Hun Sen and Ranariddh as his deputies. Ranariddh was surprised at Sihanouk's announcement, as he had not been informed of his father's plans, and joined Australia, China, the United Kingdom, and the United States in opposing the plan. The following day, Sihanouk rescinded his announcement through a national radio broadcast.On 14 June 1993, Sihanouk was reinstated as the head of state in a constituent assembly session presided over by Ranariddh, who took the opportunity to declare the 1970 coup d'\u00e9tat which overthrew Sihanouk as \"illegal\". As Head of State, Sihanouk renamed the Cambodian military to its pre-1970 namesake, the Royal Cambodian Armed Forces. He also issued orders to officially rename the country from the State of Cambodia to simply \"Cambodia\", reinstating \"Nokor Reach\" as the National Anthem of Cambodia with some minor modifications to its lyrics, and the Cambodian flag to its pre-1970 design. At the same time, Sihanouk appointed Ranariddh and Hun Sen co-prime ministers, with equal powers. This arrangement, which was provisional, was ratified by the Constituent Assembly on 2 July 1993. On 30 August 1993, Ranariddh and Hun Sen met with Sihanouk and presented two draft constitutions, one of them stipulating a constitutional monarchy headed by a king, and another a republic led by a head of state. Sihanouk opted for the draft stipulating Cambodia a constitutional monarchy, which was ratified by the constituent assembly on 21 September 1993.\n\n\n== Second reign ==\nThe new constitution came into force on 24 September 1993, and Sihanouk was reinstated as the King of Cambodia. A permanent coalition government was formed between FUNCINPEC, CPP and a third political party, the Buddhist Liberal Democratic Party (BLDP). In turn, Sihanouk made Ranariddh and Hun Sen First and Second Prime Ministers, respectively. Shortly after that, Sihanouk left for Beijing, where he spent several months for cancer treatment. In April 1994, Sihanouk returned and the following month called the government to hold new elections so that the Khmer Rouge could be co-opted into the government. Both Ranariddh and Hun Sen rejected his suggestion, but Sihanouk pressed on, and further proposed a national unity government consisting of FUNCINPEC, CPP, and the Khmer Rouge headed by him. Again, both prime ministers rejected Sihanouk's proposal, arguing that Khmer Rouge's past intransigent attitude made the proposal unrealistic. Sihanouk backed down, and expressed frustration that Hun Sen and Ranariddh had been ignoring him. As both Norodom Sirivudh and Julio Jeldres, his younger half-brother and official biographer, respectively, saw it, this was a clear sign that the monarchy's ability to exert control over national affairs had diminished, at least vis-a-vis the prime ministers.\n\nIn July 1994, one of his sons, Norodom Chakrapong, led a failed coup attempt to topple the government. Following the coup attempt, Chakrapong took refuge in a hotel in Phnom Penh, but government troops soon discovered his hideout and surrounded the hotel. Chakrapong called Sihanouk, who negotiated with government representatives to allow him to go into exile in Malaysia. The following November, Sirivudh was accused of plotting to assassinate Hun Sen and imprisoned. Sihanouk intervened to have Sirivudh detained at the interior ministry's headquarters, convinced that there was a secret plan to kill the latter if he were to remain in prison. After Sirivudh was relocated to the safer location, Sihanouk appealed to Hun Sen that Sirivudh be allowed to go into exile in France together with his family. Subsequently, Hun Sen accepted his offer.Relations between the two co-prime ministers, Ranariddh and Hun Sen, deteriorated from March 1996, when the former accused the CPP of repeatedly delaying the allocation process of low-level government posts to FUNCINPECs. Ranariddh threatened to pull out of the coalition government and hold national elections in the same year if his demands were not met, stoking unease among Hun Sen and other CPP officials. The following month, Sihanouk presided over a meeting between several royal family members and senior FUNCINPEC officials in Paris. Sihanouk attempted to reduce tensions between FUNCINPEC and the CPP by assuring that FUNCINPEC would not leave the coalition government and that there were no reactionary elements planning to bring down Hun Sen or the CPP. In March 1997, Sihanouk expressed his willingness to abdicate the throne, claiming that rising anti-royalist sentiment among the populace was threatening the monarchy's existence. In response, Hun Sen tersely warned Sihanouk that he would introduce constitutional amendments to prohibit members of the royal family from participating in politics if he followed through on his suggestion. As Widyono saw it, Sihanouk remained popular with the Cambodian electorate, and Hun Sen feared that, should he abdicate and enter politics, he would win in any future elections, thereby undercutting CPP's political clout.In July 1997, violent clashes erupted in Phnom Penh between infantry forces separately allied to the CPP and FUNCINPEC, which effectively led to Ranariddh's ousting after FUNCINPEC forces were defeated. Sihanouk voiced displeasure with Hun Sen for orchestrating the clashes, but refrained from calling Ranariddh's ouster a \"coup d'\u00e9tat\", a term which FUNCINPEC members used. When the National Assembly elected Ung Huot as the First Prime Minister to replace Ranariddh on 6 August 1997, Sihanouk charged that Ranariddh's ouster was illegal and renewed his offer to abdicate the throne, a plan which did not materialize. In September 1998, Sihanouk meditated political talks in Siem Reap after the FUNCINPEC and the Sam Rainsy Party (SRP) staged protests against the CPP-led government for irregularities over the 1998 general elections. The talks broke down at the end of the month after Hun Sen narrowly escaped an assassination attempt, which he accused Sam Rainsy of masterminding. Two months later, in November 1998, Sihanouk brokered a second round of political talks between the CPP and FUNCINPEC whereby an agreement was reached for another coalition government between the CPP and FUNCINPEC.Sihanouk maintained a monthly bulletin in which he wrote commentaries on political issues and posted old photos of Cambodia in the 1950s and 1960s. In 1997 a character known by the name of \"Ruom Rith\" first appeared in his monthly bulletin, expressing critical comments on Hun Sen and the government. Hun Sen became offended by Ruom Rith's criticisms, and on at least two occasions in 1998 and 2003 persuaded Sihanouk to stop publishing his comments. According to Ranariddh, Ruom Rith was an alter ego of Sihanouk, a claim which the latter vehemently denied. In July 2002, Sihanouk expressed concern over the absence of detailed constitutional provisions over the organization and functioning of the Cambodian throne council. When Hun Sen rejected Sihanouk's concern, the latter followed up in September 2002 by threatening to abdicate, so as to force the throne council to convene and elect a new monarch.In July 2003, general elections were held again, and the CPP won. However, they failed to secure two-thirds of all parliamentary seats, as required by the constitution to form a new government. The two runner-up parties of the election, FUNCINPEC and SRP, blocked the CPP from doing so. Instead, in August 2003 they filed complaints with the Constitutional Council over alleged electoral irregularities. After their complaints were rejected, FUNCINPEC and SRP threatened to boycott the swearing-in ceremony of parliamentarians. Sihanouk coaxed both parties to change their decision, stating that he would abstain from presiding over the ceremony as well if they did not comply with his wishes. Both parties eventually backed off from their threats, and the swearing-in ceremony was held in October 2003, with Sihanouk in attendance. The CPP, FUNCINPEC, and SRP held additional talks into 2004 to break the political stalemate, but to no avail. At the same time, Sihanouk proposed a unity government jointly led by politicians from all three political parties, which Hun Sen and Ranariddh both rebuffed.\n\n\n== Abdication and final years ==\nOn 6 July 2004, in an open letter, Sihanouk announced his plans to abdicate once again. At the same time, he criticised Hun Sen and Ranariddh for ignoring his suggestions on how to resolve the political stalemate of the past year. Meanwhile, Hun Sen and Ranariddh had agreed to introduce a constitutional amendment that provided for an open voting system, requiring parliamentarians to select cabinet ministers and the president of the National Assembly by a show of hands. Sihanouk disapproved of the open voting system, calling upon Senate President Chea Sim not to sign the amendment. When Chea Sim heeded Sihanouk's advice, he was ferried out of the country shortly before the National Assembly convened to vote on the amendment on 15 July. On 17 July 2004, the CPP and FUNCINPEC agreed to form a coalition government, leaving SRP out as an opposition party. On 6 October 2004, Sihanouk wrote a letter calling for the throne council to convene and select a successor. The National Assembly and Senate both held emergency meetings to pass laws allowing for the abdication of the monarch. On 14 October 2004, the throne council unanimously voted to select Norodom Sihamoni as Sihanouk's successor. Sihamoni was crowned as the King of Cambodia on 29 October 2004.In March 2005, Sihanouk accused Thailand, Laos, and Vietnam of encroaching into Cambodian territory, through unilateral border demarcation exercises without Cambodian participation. Two months later, Sihanouk formed the Supreme National Council on Border Affairs (SNCBA), which he headed, to address these concerns. While the SRP and Chea Sim expressed support for Sihanouk for the formation of the SNCBA, Hun Sen decided to form a separate body, National Authority on Border Affairs (NABA), to deal with border concerns, with SNCBA to serve only as an advisory body. After Hun Sen signed a border treaty with Vietnam in October 2005, Sihanouk dissolved the SNCBA. In August 2007, the Cambodian Action Committee for Justice and Equity, a US-based human rights NGO, called for Sihanouk's State immunity to be lifted, so as to allow him to testify in the Extraordinary Chambers in the Courts of Cambodia (ECCC). Sihanouk responded to the call by inviting the ECCC public affairs officer, Peter Foster, for a discussion session on his personal experience under the Khmer Rouge regime. Both Hun Sen and FUNCINPEC criticized the suggestion, with the latter accusing the NGO of being disrespectful. The ECCC subsequently rejected Sihanouk's invitation.The following year, bilateral relations between Thailand and Cambodia became strained due to overlapping claims on the land area surrounding Preah Vihear Temple. Sihanouk issued a communiqu\u00e9 in July 2008 emphasising the Khmer architecture of the temple as well as ICJ's 1962 ruling of the temple in favour of Cambodia. In August 2009, Sihanouk stated that he would stop posting messages on his personal website as he was getting old, making it difficult for him to keep up with his personal duties. Between 2009 and 2011, Sihanouk spent most of his time in Beijing for medical care. He made a final public appearance in Phnom Penh on his 89th birthday and 20th anniversary of the Paris Peace Accords on 30 October 2011. Thereafter, Sihanouk expressed his intent to stay in Cambodia indefinitely, but returned to Beijing in January 2012 for further medical treatment at the advice of his Chinese doctors.\n\n\n== Death and funeral ==\n\nIn January 2012, Sihanouk issued a letter to express his wish to be cremated after his death, and for his ashes to be interred in a golden urn. A few months later, in September 2012, Sihanouk said that he would not return to Cambodia from Beijing for his 90th birthday, citing fatigue. On 15 October 2012, Sihanouk died of a heart attack at 1:20 am, Phnom Penh time. When the news broke, Sihamoni, Hun Sen, and other government officials flew to Beijing to pay their last respects. The Cambodian government announced an official mourning period of seven days between 17 and 24 October 2012, and state flags were ordered to fly at one-third height. Two days later, Sihanouk's body was brought back from Beijing on an Air China flight, and about 1.2 million people lined the streets from the airport to the royal palace to witness the return of Sihanouk's cort\u00e8ge.In late November 2012, Hun Sen said that Sihanouk's funeral and cremation were to be carried out in February 2013. Sihanouk's body lay in state at the royal palace for the next three months until the funeral was held on 1 February 2013. A 6,000-metre (20,000 ft) street procession was held, and Sihanouk's body was subsequently kept at the royal crematorium until 4 February 2013 when his body was cremated. The following day, the royal family scattered some of Sihanouk's ashes into the Tonle Sap river, while the rest were kept in the palace's throne hall for about a year. In October 2013, a stupa featuring a bronze statue of Sihanouk was inaugurated next to the Independence Monument. In July 2014, Sihanouk's ashes were interred at the silver pagoda next to those of one of his daughters, Kantha Bopha.\n\n\n== Artistic works ==\n\n\n=== Film-making ===\n\nSihanouk produced about 50 films throughout his lifetime. He developed an interest in the cinema at a young age, which he attributed to frequent trips to the cinema with his parents. Shortly after becoming king in 1941, Sihanouk made a few amateur films, and sent Cambodian students to study film-making in France. When the film Lord Jim was released in 1965, Sihanouk was vexed with the negative portrayal it gave of Cambodia. In response, Sihanouk produced his first feature film, Apsara, in 1966. He went on to produce, direct, and act in eight more films between 1966 and 1969, roping in members of the royal family and military generals to star in his films. Sihanouk expressed that his films were created with the intent of portraying Cambodia in a positive light; Milton Osborne also noted that the films were filled with Cold War and nationalist propaganda themes. Sihanouk's former adviser, Charles Meyer, said that his films created from the 1960s were of amateur standard, while the director of Reyum Institute, Ly Daravuth, similarly commented in 2006 that his films lacked artistic qualities.In 1967, one of his films, The Enchanted Forest, was nominated at the 5th Moscow International Film Festival. In 1968, Sihanouk launched the Phnom Penh International Film Festival, which was held for a second time in 1969. In both years, a special award category was designated, the Golden Apsara Prize, of which Sihanouk was its only nominee and winner. After Sihanouk was ousted in 1970, he ceased producing films for the next seventeen years until 1987. In 1997, Sihanouk received a special jury prize from the International Film Festival of Moscow, where he revealed that he had received a budget ranging from US$20,000 to US$70,000 for each of his film productions from the Cambodian government. Six years later, Sihanouk donated his film archives to the \u00c9cole fran\u00e7aise d'Extr\u00eame-Orient in France and Monash University in Australia. In 2006, he produced his last film, Miss Asina, and then declared his retirement from film-making in May 2010.\n\n\n=== Music ===\nSihanouk wrote at least 48 musical compositions between the late 1940s and the early 1970s, combining both traditional Khmer and Western themes into his works. From the 1940s until the 1960s, Sihanouk's compositions were mostly based on sentimental, romantic and patriotic themes. Sihanouk's romantic songs reflected his numerous romantic liaisons, particularly his relationship with his wife Monique, and compositions such as \"My Darling\" and \"Monica\" were dedicated to her. He also wrote nationalistic songs, meant to showcase the beauty of provincial towns and at the same time foster a sense of patriotism and national unity among Cambodians. Notable compositions, such as \"Flower of Battambang\", \"Beauty of Kep City\", \"Phnom Kulen\", and \"Phnom Penh\", are examples of these. A few of his other compositions, including \"Luang Prabang\", \"Nostalgia of China\", and \"Goodbye Bogor\" were sentimental songs about neighbouring countries including Laos, Indonesia, and China.After he was ousted as head of state in 1970, Sihanouk wrote several revolutionary-style songs that praised the leaders of Communist countries, including \"Hommage Khmer au Mar\u00e9chal Kim Il Sung\" and \"Merci, Piste Ho Chi Minh\". They were intended to show his gratitude toward the Communist leaders, which had supported GRUNK between 1970 and 1975. From a young age, Sihanouk learned to play several musical instruments including the clarinet, saxophone, piano, and accordion. In the 1960s, Sihanouk led a musical band made up of his relatives, who would perform French songs and his own personal compositions for diplomats at the royal palace. In his tours across Cambodian provinces, Sihanouk was accompanied by the Royal Military Orchestra and Cambodian pop singers. Later, while Sihanouk was living in exile during the 1980s, he hosted concerts to entertain diplomats whenever he visited the United Nations Headquarters in New York City. After he was reinstated as king in 1993, Sihanouk continued to perform in concerts held at the royal palace on an occasional basis.\n\n\n== Titles and styles ==\n\nSihanouk was known by many formal and informal titles throughout his lifetime, and the Guinness Book of World Records identifies Sihanouk as the royal who had served the greatest variety of state and political offices. When Sihanouk became king in 1941, he was bestowed with the official title of \"Preah Bat Samdech Preah Norodom Sihanouk Varman\" (\u1796\u17d2\u179a\u17c7\u1794\u17b6\u1791\u179f\u1798\u17d2\u178f\u17c1\u1785\u1796\u17d2\u179a\u17c7 \u1793\u179a\u17c4\u178f\u17d2\u178f\u1798 \u179f\u17b8\u17a0\u1793\u17bb \u179c\u179a\u17d2\u1798\u17d0\u1793), which he used for both reigns between 1941 and 1955 and again from 1993 to 2004. He reverted to the title of Prince after he abdicated 1955, and in that year was given by his father and successor the title of \"Samdech Preah Upayuvareach\" (\u179f\u1798\u17d2\u178f\u17c1\u1785\u1796\u17d2\u179a\u17c7\u17a7\u1794\u1799\u17bb\u179c\u179a\u17b6\u1787), which translates in English as \"The Prince who has been King\". Starting from the early 1960s when he became the Head of State, Sihanouk was affectionately known to most Cambodians as \"Samdech Euv\" (\u179f\u1798\u17d2\u178f\u17c1\u1785\u17aa), which translates as the \"Prince Father\" in English.In 2004, after his second abdication, Sihanouk became known as the King Father of Cambodia, with the official title of \"Preah Karuna Preah Bat S\u00e2mdach Preah Norodom Sihanouk Preahm\u00e2haviraksat\" (Khmer: \u1796\u17d2\u179a\u17c7\u1780\u179a\u17bb\u178e\u17b6\u1796\u17d2\u179a\u17c7\u1794\u17b6\u1791\u179f\u1798\u17d2\u178f\u17c1\u1785\u1796\u17d2\u179a\u17c7 \u1793\u179a\u17c4\u178f\u17d2\u178f\u1798 \u179f\u17b8\u17a0\u1793\u17bb \u1796\u17d2\u179a\u17c7\u1798\u17a0\u17b6\u179c\u17b8\u179a\u1780\u17d2\u179f\u178f\u17d2\u179a). He was also referred to by another honorific, \"His Majesty King Norodom Sihanouk The Great Heroic King King-Father of Khmer independence, territorial integrity and national unity\" (\u1796\u17d2\u179a\u17c7\u1780\u179a\u17bb\u178e\u17b6 \u1796\u17d2\u179a\u17c7\u1794\u17b6\u1791\u179f\u1798\u17d2\u178a\u17c1\u1785\u1796\u17d2\u179a\u17c7 \u1793\u179a\u17c4\u178f\u17d2\u178f\u1798 \u179f\u17b8\u17a0\u1793\u17bb \u1796\u17d2\u179a\u17c7\u1798\u17a0\u17b6\u179c\u17b8\u179a\u1780\u17d2\u179f\u178f\u17d2\u179a \u1796\u17d2\u179a\u17c7\u179c\u179a\u179a\u17b6\u1787\u1794\u17b7\u178f\u17b6\u17af\u1780\u179a\u17b6\u1787\u17d2\u1799 \u1794\u17bc\u179a\u178e\u1797\u17b6\u1796\u1791\u17b9\u1780\u178a\u17b8 \u1793\u17b7\u1784\u17af\u1780\u1797\u17b6\u1796\u1787\u17b6\u178f\u17b7\u1781\u17d2\u1798\u17c2\u179a). At the same time, he issued a royal decree requesting to be called \"Samdech Ta\" (\u179f\u1798\u17d2\u178a\u17c1\u1785\u178f\u17b6) or \"Samdech Ta-tuot\" (\u179f\u1798\u17d2\u178a\u17c1\u1785\u178f\u17b6\u1791\u17bd\u178f), which translates as \"Grandfather\" and \"Great-grandfather\", respectively, in English. When Sihanouk died in October 2012, he was bestowed by his son Sihamoni with the posthumous title of \"Preah Karuna Preah Norodom Sihanouk Preah Borom Ratanakkot\" (\u1796\u17d2\u179a\u17c7\u1780\u179a\u17bb\u178e\u17b6\u1796\u17d2\u179a\u17c7\u1793\u179a\u17c4\u178f\u17d2\u178f\u1798 \u179f\u17b8\u17a0\u1793\u17bb \u1796\u17d2\u179a\u17c7\u1794\u179a\u1798\u179a\u178f\u1793\u1780\u17c4\u178a\u17d2\u178b), which literally translates as \"The King who lies in the Diamond Urn\" in English.\n\n\n== Personal life ==\nSihanouk's name is derived from two Sanskrit words \"Siha\" (\u0938\u093f\u0902\u0939) and \"Hanu\" (\u0939\u0928\u0941), which translates as \"Lion\" and \"Jaws\", respectively, in English. He was fluent in Khmer, French, and English, and also learned Greek and Latin in high school. In his high school days, Sihanouk played football, basketball, volleyball, and also took up horse riding. He suffered from diabetes and depression in the 1960s, which flared up again in the late 1970s while living in captivity under the Khmer Rouge. In November 1992, Sihanouk suffered a stroke caused by the thickening of the coronary arteries and blood vessels. In 1993, he was diagnosed with B cell lymphoma in the prostate and was treated with chemotherapy and surgery. Sihanouk's lymphoma went into remission in 1995, but returned again in 2005 in the gastric region. He suffered a third bout of lymphoma in 2008, and after prolonged treatment it went into remission the following year.In 1960, Sihanouk built a personal residence at Chamkarmon District where he lived over the next ten years as the Head of State. Following his overthrow in 1970, Sihanouk took up residence in Beijing, where he lived at the Diaoyutai State Guesthouse in the first year of his stay. In 1971, Sihanouk moved to a larger residence in the city that once housed the French embassy. The residence was equipped with a temperature-adjustable swimming pool, cinema and seven chefs. In 1974 North Korean leader Kim Il-sung built Changsuwon, a 40-room mansion, for Sihanouk. Changsuwon was built near an artificial lake, and Sihanouk spent time taking boat trips there and also shot a few films within the compound. In August 2008, Sihanouk declared his assets on his website, which according to him consisted of a small house in Siem Reap and 30,000 Euros of cash savings stored in a French bank. He also stated that his residences in Beijing and Pyongyang were guesthouses owned by the governments of China and North Korea, respectively, and that they did not belong to him.\n\n\n=== Family ===\n\nIn April 1952 Sihanouk married Paule Monique Izzi, who was the daughter of Pomme Peang, a Cambodian, and Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Izzi, a French banker of Italian ancestry. Monique became Sihanouk's lifelong partner; in the 1990s she changed her name to Monineath. Before his marriage to Monique, Sihanouk married five other women: Phat Kanhol, Sisowath Pongsanmoni, Sisowath Monikessan, Mam Manivan Phanivong, and Thavet Norleak. Monikessan died in childbirth in 1946; his marriages to the other four women all ended in divorce. Sihanouk had fourteen children with five different wives. Thavet Norleak bore him no children. During the Khmer Rouge years, five children and fourteen grandchildren disappeared; Sihanouk believed they were killed by the Khmer Rouge.Sihanouk had the following issue:\n\n\n=== Ancestry ===\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\n\n\n=== Books ===\nBurchett, William G.; Norodom, Sihanouk (1973).

          "Worth taking a look here, the tree-lined park and nicely-lit pathways are nice for a stroll, especially at night. The statue is quite breathtaking in the evening with the lights around it. Hardly any tourists about when I was there.",

          "Large square popular with local people in the evening with statues and light display. Good for an evening stroll.",
          "Walked around the rotunda enclosing the Statue of Norodom Sihanouk. This man may have truly done a lot for Cambodia for him to be enshrined in a temple like structure with his statue inside.",

          "I walked by this and the independence monument a few times traveling to and from my hotel. Nice open space, but it is also a large traffic circle, so it can get noisy.",
          "This statue is iconic in Phnom Penh and close to the Independence Monument. Plan to do both together and careful with the traffic.",
          "The statue here is nice. It\u2019s in a nice garden too. Well worth a wander if you are walking around Phn\u00f4m Penh.",
          "Nice memorial, but not worth the time and traffic to go see. The plaza is usually crowded and getting a good picture can be tough.",
          "Good to visit for a photo opportunity , driving past stopped to get the shot , wouldn\u2019t make a special trip",
          "yes, it's just a few yards away from the independence monument, and yes, it looks better at night. totally nice for photography",
          "The best way to see PP is by walking - and this statue should form part of your tour. Crossing the road in PP is a bit of a leap of faith but trust us, we never saw anyone get run over! When you do, you'll get to see this and other monuments close up. Enjoy",

          "Having just whizzed by the Independence monument ,which can be seen in the distance from this statue, we managed to get our over enthusiastic tuk tuk driver to stop so we could wander about & take photos. We could look past the King & see both structures at once which was just",
          "Lovely tribute to the king, very impressive shame about its location. Great to see and take photos but don't be disappointed if you miss it",
          "The statue made for a good centrepiece attraction in my recent photographs.It was flattering to the individual photograph from each and every angle. The dusk light was perfectly and passing tuk tuks could be framed in the shots. How photogenic!",
          "We drove by when we went to the killing fields. A lot of traffic around. Our driver stopped for some pictures",
          "There's whole lot of traffic around so getting to the statue is bit daunting, but the walk in the evening is nice.",
          "Surrounded as this park is on all sides by the rather frantic Phnom Penh traffic flows, getting to this statue and the surrounding park can be a little difficult. The statue is interesting to look at, but perhaps not something I would come visiting specifically.",
          "Better to visit in evening and you can cover nearby area also good for taking pics. You can relax also there in the evening.",
          "This statue is part of a long park that runs through the middle of a busy street. As far as statues go it\u2019s okay. The meaning for Cambodians is a bit more since it\u2019s a statue of one of their most beloved kings. As a tourist however it\u2019s not as meaningful, but still nice enough.",
          "Walked down a long narrow park ( between two main roads) to get here. OK, it is a statue of some significance to the locals, but for me it was nothing special- sorry!",
          "Walk through the park and enjoy the sun going down. Do not book a tour and ignore the tuktuk-drivers on the sidewalk... you need about 10-20 minutes to enjoy this landmark.",
          "You just see the statue of the king. The area is nice and wide - right in the middle of the city. It will be part of the tour visit",
          "Right next to independence monument, it is worth coming at night when it is lit up as it looks very pretty",
          "Most Cambodians today revere Sihanouk. In fair measure because they are not told of his significant r\u00f4le in bringing about the victory of the Khmer Rouge in 1974. A playboy - with a dangerous taste for absolute power.",

          "No just a great monument place, Phnom Penh people will kept in mind to all successful in past of Cambodia history.",
          "It seems to be constantly noisy around here with traffic moving everywhere. The monument itself is nice enough and seems to be well maintained without any obvious vandalism. Worth a look if you happen to be in the vicinity but not really fantastic enough to justify a visit just",
          "Its is amazing how much wealth like this is surrounded by the poverty. Still it is a very impressive monument to the king.",
          "Very interesting place, huge area for people to do any activities. No parking lot, becareful of any kind transportation. They just drive like always in hurry.",
          "I stood here for couple of photos but had to wait to long for traffic to clear, during the peak hours for me to have good view.",
          "In the broad park-like median of bustling Sihanouk Blvd, this is an iconic landmark for the capital city. King Sihanouk is revered as \"father of his country,\" instrumental in establishing independence from the French. Do stop by here & the Independence Monument nearby. A",

          "An impressive memorial with a tablet that gives the story of the King and his many achievements I saw it at dawn, set off against a clear sky",
          "The design and craftmanship is awesome but you really can see this from a tuk tuk, car or roof top bar. All the monuments in the median strip are lit up at night.",
          "The monument is good, at least it has a statue, not so boring as the independence monument near it. The good thing is also that you can walk around it in the boulevard, and for the pictures the Independence monumen appears behind it. Yet, a 5-minute visit.",
          "The iconic place in the heart of capital, drop by in the evening for walk enjoy, jogging with local or join the aerobic dance next by for evening work out. Nothing is required. Just enjoy your walk before drop by any restaurant or bar within the walking distance.",
          "He was obviously well liked because he ended French Colonial rule and there wss peace under his reign. A wide park like boulevard leads to his statue and the Independence Monuent beyond. the thing we noticed most was that the park was clean and litter free - so it is possible.",
          "A majestic tribute and statue of the late great King who fought for the independence of Cambodia. This is a great place to spend your late afternoon or dawn jogging around and feel the fresh and green park. It's not so big but beautiful. It's a bit challenging to take nice photo",
          "The Royal Palace, the Silver Pagoda and the Statue are walking distances from one another. If you are already in the area, you might as well explore whatever else you can. It was nice to see it.",
          "It's very near to the Independence monument and it's situated in a square. It doesen't take to much time to visit it and it is worth visiting. If you can choose visit both on the late afternoon/night (by sunset).",
          "Most beautiful at night time and a very nice area to walk. Or day time is also good and then see the Independence monument. It is pretty much the center of Phnom Penh and there are also many places to eat, food stalls along the street or restaurants.",
          "In this area are two significant monuments, this one and Independence one. Both are similar in style and a nice photo op, specially at night when lit up. The beautifully arranged area in the middle of that big street is a nice place to walk down to the river and central PP.",
          "God to see this as part of a cultural walk - that we did easily ourselves. In a good site , clean and tidy and we could sit here for a break and take photos.",
          "Nice path to take a walk here during the lights lit. Just go and take a picture here. you also can rest here and take a look the surrounding There is a restaurant opposite this",
          "Have a walk around this area after watching Apsara Traditional Dance at the National Museum. Good to have a walk and sightseeing here at night. There also several stalls selling food along the avenue.",
          "If you want to know more about his role in Cambodian mind, you may need a tour guide to tell you about this.",

          "This statue is nice to see but not really something to go out of the way to see . You can only get to the steps as the statue is shut off",
          "It is just by the Independence monument, and you can kill two birds with one stone. Like the monument, it is also lit up at night. Also, the park area between the two lanes of traffic is full of locals hanging out in the evenings.",
          "A magnificent tribute, monument and statue of the King on this large and green pedestrian pathway. A very nice walk at sunrise or sunset",
          "Impossible to miss this as it is right alongside one of the main roads so I passed it a number of times. Impressive and a memorial to a person whose name was very familiar to me.",
          "Another one that can be seen whilst driving past - otherwise pull over and take a stroll to see up close. This was a very much loved King in Cambodia.",
          "If you are viewing the independence monumnet you cant help but see this statue which stands in gardens less than 100m from the independence monumnet- the gardens are well manicured and this is well worth 10-15 mins of your time.",
          "It's exactly that, you stop snap a quick pic and keep moving. I can barely fill 100 character minimum for it.",
          "The statue is definitely worthwhile to visit, but I recommend at night because the statue bathed in the surrounding lights makes a great photo opp.",
          "A nice statue situated in the pleasant green area leading up to the independence monument, it was just a short stroll through a park from our hotel so this statue, Independence monument, Cambodia-Vietnam Friendship monument are all within a few hundred metres of each other.",

          "We only did a drive by with the tuk-tuk which for us was sufficient. If your hotel is close enough, walk to it. It's an impressive monument.",
          "Include this statue with a walk along all the public area in the general vicinity, including independence monument nearby. At night, this area hums with activity! And if you can brave crossing the intersections, just walk and explore to see how the people from Phnom Penh have a",

          "A nice statue to take photos of with the monument in the background. Just a shame with the white and red modern plastic fencing around it to stop people from going too close. Ruined it a little bit",
          "The statue is located on Phnom Penh's nicest boulevard, near the Independence Monument, leading to the modern and booming area of Diamond Island. Make a point of driving by to see it and even make a quick stop for a photo.",
          "This statue is nearby to Independent monument and on a huge square. Architecture wise, it was just average nothing too impressive. But there are many people at the square. Some playing balls and stuff. It is nice place to just hangout and see life takes place in Phnom Penh, but",

          "We moved away just shortly after the King Father passed away. So it was nice for us to visit his Statue. It is big, but i would have liked to think they should have portrayed the 'man' a bit bigger or closer rather. He seems very hidden away under the 'roof' and i cannot",
          "This is close to few other monuments like Vietnam -Cambodia Friendship tower, Independence Monument etc and is located along a park. As opposed to other parts of the town, it is quite clean and tempting for a good walk!",

          "It is located nearby the independent monument, so you can visit them altogether. Anyway, be careful as you have to survive a heavy traffic before reaching the place. The night view is pretty too.",
          "Well, is hard to get to with needing to run across lots of lanes of traffic. And once there not all that sure you are allowed to go to top or not. All blocked off and guard but I went up and he was sleeping on a cot in corner so I looked, took photos and left.",

          "They call him the King Father and Norodom Sihanouk has a fitting memorial, a short stroll from the Independence Monument. You won't spend too long here, as there isn't all that much to see, but it makes for a good photo-opp, especially with the juxtaposition of the modern Phnom",
          "Our evening walks will always pass this monument and the key things to do here is to watch what the locals are doing and how they enjoy themselves. Forget about the man. Read about him and make your own judgement. He is definitely revered by the people but they don't know what",
          "Interesting to read about his reign. Cool to view at night. Can easily view riding by. He was greatly admired by his countrymen.",
          "A sight to be seen and a great photo opportunity. The area around the statue is pretty and serene and relaxing.",
          "We were here late in the afternoon, the monument looks good as the sun is going down but to just stand there and watch the locals who flock to the park to exercise is amazing",
          "Bad style, no interest at all which anyhow matches the reign of this person who led his country in its darkest times",
          "Not of special interest. It is central and you will walk past it anyway - so why not spend a few minutes.",

          "Nice monument in central Phnom Penh, worth a visit as also close to the Independence monument and monument to the Vietnamese",
          "Like other reviews this statue of the King and the Independence monument are very close to each other. Best time to visit is in the evening while it is lit up and all the locals are doing their local excersise and dance groups well worth a look.",
          "As others mentioned already, \"it's just a statue\", but worth visiting in the evening because of the fab illuminations, the activities on the sidewalks, and the bustle of life all around. It's really nice to walk around here for a couple of hours, then stop for dinner at one of",

          "I came across this by chance, It's a huge Statue, i believe of their former King? I apologise if i'm wrong. It is South of the Royal palace on the way to the Independence Monument. It is set in some nice gardens and tree lined walkways",

          "This is one of the stops my tuktuk driver and I did for our day trip. We took pictures of the statue and other attractions located in the big boulevard. We were in a rush as it was very hot and had more attractions to visit. I would definitely go back to this area either early",

          "We were doing a bit of a DIY walking tour and this was up next... From a westerners point of view it could be just another monument/statue. But it actually means a lot to the locals as he has been the most important man in recent history in Cambodia.",
          "I really like this statue as usual. The location is nearby the Independence monument of Phnom Penh. The statue look really awesome in early morning with the sunrise or at night with lighting give more attention.",
          "Another attraction that I wouldn't advise going out of your way for but is worth a stop and look if you happen to be going past it, which you most likely will at some point. It's a well constructed statue that can look pretty cool against a sunset colored backdrop.",
          "Just stroll a little further in from the Independence monument and you can enjoy this monument to the late King. It is beautifully housed and surrounded by lovely parkland. The park is frequented by locals early morning and late afternoon exercising. Great community feeling",
          "I fact, the king is mostly seen in photos or movies waving with his right hand in the air, smiling. The statue in his honour shows him as a very serious man with his hands crossed in front of his body, not at all a posture which honours his openness with the people. The King's",

        "wiki": "A wat (Khmer: \u179c\u178f\u17d2\u178f w\u014dat; Lao: \u0ea7\u0eb1\u0e94 vat; Thai: \u0e27\u0e31\u0e14,RTGS: wat,pronounced [w\u00e1t]; Tai L\u00fc: \u300c\u1a45\u1a2f\u1a60\u1a30\u300d\uff08waD+Dha\uff09; Northern Thai: \u300c\u1a45\u1a60\u1a2f\u1a76\u300d\uff08w+Da2\uff09) is a type of Buddhist temple and Hindu temple in Cambodia, Laos, East Shan State, Yunnan and Thailand. The word wat is a thai word that was borrowed from Sanskrit v\u0101\u1e6da (Devan\u0101gar\u012b: \u0935\u093e\u091f), meaning 'enclosure'. The term has varying meanings in each region, sometimes referring to a specific type of government-recognised or large temple, other times referring to any Buddhist or Hindu temple.\n\n\n== Overview ==\n\nStrictly speaking, a wat is a Buddhist sacred precinct with vihara (quarters for bhikkhus), a temple, an edifice housing a large image of Buddha and a facility for lessons. A site without a minimum of three resident bhikkhus cannot correctly be described as a wat although the term is frequently used more loosely, even for ruins of ancient temples. As a transitive or intransitive verb, wat means to measure, to take measurements; compare templum, from which temple derives, having the same root as template.\nIn Cambodia, a wat is any place of worship. \"Wat\" generally refers to a Buddhist place of worship, but the precise term is \u179c\u178f\u17d2\u178f\u1796\u17bb\u1791\u17d2\u1792\u179f\u17b6\u179f\u1793\u17b6 wat putthasasana.  A Christian church can be referred as \u179c\u17b7\u17a0\u17b6\u179a\u1799\u17c1\u179f\u17ca\u17bc vihear Yesaou or \"Jesus vihear\".

It is 181,035 square kilometres (69,898 square miles) in area, bordered by Thailand to the northwest, Laos to the northeast, Vietnam to the east and the Gulf of Thailand to the southwest. \nThe sovereign state of Cambodia has a population of over 15 million. The official religion is Theravada Buddhism, practised by approximately 95 percent of the population. Cambodia's minority groups include Vietnamese, Chinese, Chams and 30 hill tribes. The capital and largest city is Phnom Penh, the political, economic and cultural centre of Cambodia. The kingdom is an elective constitutional monarchy with a monarch, currently Norodom Sihamoni, chosen by the Royal Council of the Throne as head of state. The head of government is the Prime Minister, currently Hun Sen, the longest serving non-royal leader in Southeast Asia, ruling Cambodia since 1985.\nIn 802 AD, Jayavarman II declared himself king, uniting the warring Khmer princes of Chenla under the name \"Kambuja\". This marked the beginning of the Khmer Empire, which flourished for over 600 years, allowing successive kings to control and exert influence over much of Southeast Asia and accumulate immense power and wealth. The Indianised kingdom facilitated the spread of first Hinduism and then Buddhism to much of Southeast Asia and undertook many religious infrastructural projects throughout the region, including the construction of more than 1,000 temples and monuments in Angkor alone. Angkor Wat is the most famous of these structures and is designated as a World Heritage Site.\nIn the fifteenth century, after the rebellion of Ayutthaya, which was formerly ruled by the Khmer Empire, Cambodia experienced the decline of power. Cambodia faced two increasingly powerful neighbors, Ayutthaya of Thailand and Nguyen dynasty of Vietnam, and marking the downturn of Cambodia's fate. In 1863, Cambodia became a protectorate of France, and later was incorporated into French Indochina of Southeast Asia.\nCambodia gained independence from France in 1953. The Vietnam War extended into the country in 1965 with the expansion of the Ho Chi Minh Trail and establishment of the Sihanouk Trail. This led to the US bombing of Cambodia from 1969 until 1973. Following the Cambodian coup of 1970 which installed the right-wing pro-US Khmer Republic, the deposed King Sihanouk gave his support to his former enemies, the Khmer Rouge. With the support of the monarchy and North Vietnam, the Khmer Rouge emerged as a major power, taking Phnom Penh in 1975. The Khmer Rouge then carried out the Cambodian genocide from 1975 until 1979, when they were ousted by Vietnam and the Vietnamese-backed People's Republic of Kampuchea, supported by the Soviet Union, in the Cambodian\u2013Vietnamese War.\nFollowing the 1991 Paris Peace Accords, Cambodia was governed briefly by a United Nations mission (1992\u201393). The UN withdrew after holding elections in which around 90 percent of the registered voters cast ballots. The 1997 factional fighting resulted in the ousting of the government by Prime Minister Hun Sen and the Cambodian People's Party, who remain in power as of April 2020.\nCambodia is a member of the United Nations since 1955, ASEAN, the East Asia Summit, the WTO, the Non-Aligned Movement and La Francophonie. According to several foreign organisations, the country has widespread poverty, pervasive corruption, lack of political freedoms, low human development and a high rate of hunger. Cambodia has been described by Human Rights Watch's Southeast Asian Director, David Roberts, as a \"relatively authoritarian coalition via a superficial democracy\". Constitutionally a multi-party liberal democracy, the country is effectively governed under one-party rule as of 2018.While per capita income remains low compared to most neighboring countries, Cambodia has one of the fastest growing economies in Asia, with growth averaging 7.6 percent over the last decade. Agriculture remains the dominant economic sector, with strong growth in textiles, construction, garments and tourism leading to increased foreign investment and international trade. The United Nations designates Cambodia as a least developed country. The US World Justice Project's 2015 Rule of Law Index ranked Cambodia 125th out of 126 countries, far lower compared to other countries in the region.\n\n\n== Name ==\n\nThe \"Kingdom of Cambodia\" is the official English name of the country. The English \"Cambodia\" is an anglicisation of the French \"Cambodge\", which in turn is the French transliteration of the Khmer \u1780\u1798\u17d2\u1796\u17bb\u1787\u17b6 kampuci\u0259. Kampuchea is the shortened alternative to the country's official name in Khmer \u1796\u17d2\u179a\u17c7\u179a\u17b6\u1787\u17b6\u178e\u17b6\u1785\u1780\u17d2\u179a\u1780\u1798\u17d2\u1796\u17bb\u1787\u17b6 pr\u0115\u0259h ri\u0259ci\u0259naacak kampuci\u0259. The Khmer endonym Kampuchea derives from the Sanskrit name \u0915\u092e\u094d\u092c\u094b\u091c\u0926\u0947\u0936 kambojade\u015ba, composed of \u0926\u0947\u0936 de\u015ba (\"land of\" or \"country of\") and \u0915\u092e\u094d\u092c\u094b\u091c kamboja, which alludes to the foundation myths of the first ancient Khmer kingdom. The term Cambodia was already in use in Europe as early as 1524, since Antonio Pigafetta (an Italian explorer who followed Ferdinand Magellan in his circumnavigation of the globe) cites it in his work Relazione del primo viaggio intorno al mondo (1524-1525) as Camogia.Colloquially, Cambodians refer to their country as either \u179f\u17d2\u179a\u17bb\u1780\u1781\u17d2\u1798\u17c2\u179a srok khmae (Khmer pronunciation: [srok \u02c8k\u02b0mae]), meaning \"Khmer's Land\", or the slightly more formal \u1794\u17d2\u179a\u1791\u17c1\u179f\u1780\u1798\u17d2\u1796\u17bb\u1787\u17b6 pr\u0251teih kampuci\u0259 (Khmer pronunciation: [pr\u0251.\u02c8teih kam.pu.ci\u0259]), literally \"Country of Kampuchea\". The name \"Cambodia\" is used most often in the Western world while \"Kampuchea\" is more widely used in the East.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Pre-history ===\n\nThere exists sparse evidence for a Pleistocene human occupation of present-day Cambodia, which includes quartz and quartzite pebble tools found in terraces along the Mekong River, in Stung Treng and Krati\u00e9 provinces, and in Kampot Province, although their dating is unreliable. Some slight archaeological evidence shows communities of hunter-gatherers inhabited the region during Holocene: the most ancient archaeological discovery site in Cambodia is considered to be the cave of L'aang Spean, in Battambang Province, which belongs to the Hoabinhian period. Excavations in its lower layers produced a series of radiocarbon dates around 6000 BC. Upper layers in the same site gave evidence of transition to Neolithic, containing the earliest dated earthenware ceramics in Cambodia.Archaeological records for the period between Holocene and Iron Age remain equally limited. A pivotal event in Cambodian prehistory was the slow penetration of the first rice farmers from the north, which began in the late 3rd millennium BC. The most curious prehistoric evidence in Cambodia are the various \"circular earthworks\" discovered in the red soils near Memot and in the adjacent region of Vietnam in the latter 1950s. Their function and age are still debated, but some of them possibly date from 2nd millennium BC.\n\nOther prehistoric sites of somewhat uncertain date are Samrong Sen (not far from the ancient capital of Oudong), where the first investigations began in 1875, and Phum Snay, in the northern province of Banteay Meanchey. An excavation at Phum Snay revealed 21 graves with iron weapons and cranial trauma which could point to conflicts in the past, possible with larger cities in Angkor. Prehistoric artefacts are often found during mining activities in Ratanakiri.Iron was worked by about 500 BC, with supporting evidence coming from the Khorat Plateau, in modern-day Thailand. In Cambodia, some Iron Age settlements were found beneath Baksei Chamkrong and other Angkorian temples while circular earthworks were found beneath Lovea a few kilometres north-west of Angkor. Burials, much richer than other types of finds, testify to improvement of food availability and trade (even on long distances: in the 4th century BC trade relations with India were already opened) and the existence of a social structure and labour organisation.Among the artefacts from the Iron Age, glass beads are important evidence. Different kinds of glass beads recovered from several sites across Cambodia, such as the Phum Snay site in northwest and the Prohear site in southeast, show that there were two main trading networks at the time. The two networks were separated by time and space, which indicate that there was a shift from one network to the other at about 2nd\u20134th century AD, probably with changes in socio-political powers.\n\n\n=== Pre-Angkorian and Angkorian era ===\n\nDuring the 3rd, 4th, and 5th centuries, the Indianised states of Funan and its successor, Chenla, coalesced in present-day Cambodia and southwestern Vietnam. For more than 2,000 years, what was to become Cambodia absorbed influences from India, passing them on to other Southeast Asian civilisations that are now Thailand and Laos. Little else is known for certain of these polities, however Chinese chronicles and tribute records do make mention of them. It is believed that the territory of Funan may have held the port known to Alexandrian geographer Claudius Ptolemy as \"Kattigara\". The Chinese chronicles suggest that after Jayavarman I of Chenla died around 690, turmoil ensued which resulted in division of the kingdom into Land Chenla and Water Chenla which was loosely ruled by weak princes under the dominion of Java.\nThe Khmer Empire grew out of these remnants of Chenla, becoming firmly established in 802 when Jayavarman II (reigned c790-850) declared independence from Java and proclaimed himself a Devaraja. He and his followers instituted the cult of the God-king and began a series of conquests that formed an empire which flourished in the area from the 9th to the 15th centuries. During the rule of Jayavarman VIII the Angkor empire was attacked by the Mongol army of Kublai Khan, however the king was able to buy peace. Around the 13th century, monks from Sri Lanka introduced Theravada Buddhism to Southeast Asia. The religion spread and eventually displaced Hinduism and Mahayana Buddhism as the popular religion of Angkor; however it was not the official state religion until 1295; when Indravarman III took power.The Khmer Empire was Southeast Asia's largest empire during the 12th century. The empire's centre of power was Angkor, where a series of capitals were constructed during the empire's zenith. In 2007 an international team of researchers using satellite photographs and other modern techniques concluded that Angkor had been the largest pre-industrial city in the world with an urban sprawl of 2,980 square kilometres (1,151 square miles). The city, which could have supported a population of up to one million people and Angkor Wat, the best known and best-preserved religious temple at the site, still serves as a reminder of Cambodia's past as a major regional power. The empire, though in decline, remained a significant force in the region until its fall in the 15th century.\n\n\n=== Post-Angkor Period ===\n\nAfter a long series of wars with neighbouring kingdoms, Angkor was sacked by the Ayutthaya Kingdom and abandoned in 1432 because of ecological failure and infrastructure breakdown. This led to a period of economic, social, and cultural stagnation when the kingdom's internal affairs came increasingly under the control of its neighbours. By this time, the Khmer penchant for monument building had ceased. Older faiths such as Mahayana Buddhism and the Hindu cult of the god-king had been supplanted by Theravada Buddhism.\nThe court moved the capital to Longvek where the kingdom sought to regain its glory through maritime trade. The first mention of Cambodia in European documents was in 1511 by the Portuguese. Portuguese travellers described the city as a place of flourishing wealth and foreign trade. Continued wars with Ayutthaya and the Vietnamese resulted in the loss of more territory and Longvek being conquered and destroyed by King Naresuan the Great of Ayutthaya in 1594. A new Khmer capital was established at Oudong south of Longvek in 1618, but its monarchs could survive only by entering into what amounted to alternating vassal relationships with the Siamese and Vietnamese for the next three centuries with only a few short-lived periods of relative independence.\nThe hill tribe people in Cambodia were \"hunted incessantly and carried off as slaves by the Siamese (Thai), the Annamites (Vietnamese), and the Cambodians\".In the nineteenth century a renewed struggle between Siam and Vietnam for control of Cambodia resulted in a period when Vietnamese officials attempted to force the Khmers to adopt Vietnamese customs. This led to several rebellions against the Vietnamese and appeals to Thailand for assistance. The Siamese\u2013Vietnamese War (1841\u20131845) ended with an agreement to place the country under joint suzerainty. This later led to the signing of a treaty for French Protection of Cambodia by King Norodom Prohmborirak.\n\n\n=== French colonisation ===\n\nIn 1863, King Norodom, who had been installed by Siam, sought the protection of Cambodia from Siam by French rule. In 1867, Rama IV signed a treaty with France, renouncing suzerainty over Cambodia in exchange for the control of Battambang and Siem Reap provinces which officially became part of Siam. The provinces were ceded back to Cambodia by a border treaty between France and Siam in 1907.\nCambodia continued as a protectorate of France from 1867 to 1953, administered as part of the colony of French Indochina, though occupied by the Japanese empire from 1941 to 1945. Between 1874 and 1962, the total population increased from about 946,000 to 5.7 million. After King Norodom's death in 1904, France manipulated the choice of king, and Sisowath, Norodom's brother, was placed on the throne. The throne became vacant in 1941 with the death of Monivong, Sisowath's son, and France passed over Monivong's son, Monireth, feeling he was too independently minded. Instead, Norodom Sihanouk, a maternal grandson of King Sisowath was enthroned. The French thought young Sihanouk would be easy to control. They were wrong, however, and under the reign of King Norodom Sihanouk, Cambodia gained independence from France on 9 November 1953.\n\n\n=== Independence and Vietnam War ===\n\nCambodia became a constitutional monarchy under King Norodom Sihanouk. When French Indochina was given independence, Cambodia lost hope of regaining control over the Mekong Delta as it was awarded to Vietnam. Formerly part of the Khmer Empire, the area had been controlled by the Vietnamese since 1698, with King Chey Chettha II granting the Vietnamese permission to settle in the area decades before. This remains a diplomatic sticking point with over one million ethnic Khmers (the Khmer Krom) still living in this region. The Khmer Rouge attempted invasions to recover the territory which, in part, led to Vietnam's invasion of Cambodia and deposition of the Khmer Rouge.\n\nIn 1955, Sihanouk abdicated in favour of his father to participate in politics and was elected prime minister. Upon his father's death in 1960, Sihanouk again became head of state, taking the title of prince. As the Vietnam War progressed, Sihanouk adopted an official policy of neutrality in the Cold War. Sihanouk allowed the Vietnamese communists to use Cambodia as a sanctuary and a supply route for their arms and other aid to their armed forces fighting in South Vietnam. This policy was perceived as humiliating by many Cambodians. In December 1967 Washington Post journalist Stanley Karnow was told by Sihanouk that if the US wanted to bomb the Vietnamese communist sanctuaries, he would not object, unless Cambodians were killed.The same message was conveyed to US President Johnson's emissary Chester Bowles in January 1968. However, in public Sihanouk refuted the right of the U.S. to use air strikes in Cambodia, and on 26 March he said \"these criminal attacks must immediately and definitively stop\". On 28 March a press conference was held and Sihanouk appealed to the international media: \"I appeal to you to publicise abroad this very clear stand of Cambodia\u2014that is, I will in any case oppose all bombings on Cambodian territory under whatever pretext.\" Nevertheless, the public pleas of Sihanouk were ignored and the bombing continued. Members of the government and army became resentful of Sihanouk's ruling style as well as his tilt away from the United States.\n\n\n=== Khmer Republic (1970\u201375) ===\n\nWhile visiting Beijing in 1970 Sihanouk was ousted by a military coup led by Prime Minister General Lon Nol and Prince Sisowath Sirik Matak. US support for the coup remains unproven. However, once the coup was completed, the new regime, which immediately demanded that the Vietnamese communists leave Cambodia, gained the political support of the United States. The North Vietnamese and Viet Cong forces, desperate to retain their sanctuaries and supply lines from North Vietnam, immediately launched armed attacks on the new government. The king urged his followers to help in overthrowing this government, hastening the onset of civil war.\n\nSoon Khmer Rouge rebels began using him to gain support. However, from 1970 until early 1972, the Cambodian conflict was largely one between the government and army of Cambodia, and the armed forces of North Vietnam. As they gained control of Cambodian territory, the Vietnamese communists imposed a new political infrastructure, which was eventually dominated by the Cambodian communists now referred to as the Khmer Rouge. Between 1969 and 1973, Republic of Vietnam and US forces bombed Cambodia in an effort to disrupt the Viet Cong and Khmer Rouge.\nDocuments uncovered from the Soviet archives after 1991 reveal that the North Vietnamese attempt to overrun Cambodia in 1970 was launched at the explicit request of the Khmer Rouge and negotiated by Pol Pot's then second in command, Nuon Chea. NVA units overran many Cambodian army positions while the Communist Party of Kampuchea (CPK) expanded their small-scale attacks on lines of communication. In response to the North Vietnamese invasion, US President Richard Nixon announced that US and South Vietnamese ground forces had entered Cambodia in a campaign aimed at destroying NVA base areas in Cambodia (see Cambodian Incursion). Although a considerable quantity of equipment was seized or destroyed by US and South Vietnamese forces, containment of North Vietnamese forces proved elusive.\nThe Khmer Republic's leadership was plagued by disunity among its three principal figures: Lon Nol, Sihanouk's cousin Sirik Matak, and National Assembly leader In Tam. Lon Nol remained in power in part because neither of the others was prepared to take his place. In 1972, a constitution was adopted, a parliament elected, and Lon Nol became president. But disunity, the problems of transforming a 30,000-man army into a national combat force of more than 200,000 men, and spreading corruption weakened the civilian administration and army.\nThe Communist insurgency inside Cambodia continued to grow, aided by supplies and military support from North Vietnam. Pol Pot and Ieng Sary asserted their dominance over the Vietnamese-trained communists, many of whom were purged. At the same time, the CPK forces became stronger and more independent of their Vietnamese patrons. By 1973, the CPK were fighting battles against government forces with little or no North Vietnamese troop support, and they controlled nearly 60% of Cambodia's territory and 25% of its population. The government made three unsuccessful attempts to enter into negotiations with the insurgents, but by 1974, the CPK were operating openly as divisions, and some of the NVA combat forces had moved into South Vietnam. Lon Nol's control was reduced to small enclaves around the cities and main transportation routes. More than 2 million refugees from the war lived in Phnom Penh and other cities.\nOn New Year's Day 1975, Communist troops launched an offensive which, in 117 days of the hardest fighting of the war, collapsed the Khmer Republic. Simultaneous attacks around the perimeter of Phnom Penh pinned down Republican forces, while other CPK units overran fire bases controlling the vital lower Mekong resupply route. A US-funded airlift of ammunition and rice ended when Congress refused additional aid for Cambodia. The Lon Nol government in Phnom Penh surrendered on 17 April 1975, just five days after the US mission evacuated Cambodia.\n\n\n=== Khmer Rouge regime, 1975\u20131978 ===\n\nThe Khmer Rouge reached Phnom Penh and took power in 1975. Led by Pol Pot, they changed the official name of the country to Democratic Kampuchea. The new regime modelled itself on Maoist China during the Great Leap Forward, immediately evacuated the cities, and sent the entire population on forced marches to rural work projects. They attempted to rebuild the country's agriculture on the model of the 11th century, discarded Western medicine and destroyed temples, libraries, and anything considered Western.\nEstimates as to how many people were killed by the Khmer Rouge regime range from approximately one to three million; the most commonly cited figure is two million (about a quarter of the population). This era gave rise to the term Killing Fields, and the prison Tuol Sleng became notorious for its history of mass killing. Hundreds of thousands fled across the border into neighbouring Thailand. The regime disproportionately targeted ethnic minority groups. The Cham Muslims suffered serious purges with as much as half of their population exterminated. Pol Pot was determined to keep his power and disenfranchise any enemies or potential threats, and thus increased his violent and aggressive actions against his people.Forced repatriation in 1970 and deaths during the Khmer Rouge era reduced the Vietnamese population in Cambodia from between 250,000 and 300,000 in 1969 to a reported 56,000 in 1984. However, most of the victims of the Khmer Rouge regime were not ethnic minorities but ethnic Khmer. Professionals, such as doctors, lawyers and teachers, were also targeted. According to Robert D. Kaplan, \"eyeglasses were as deadly as the yellow star\" as they were seen as a sign of intellectualism.Religious institutions were not spared by the Khmer Rouge either. Religion was so viciously persecuted to such a terrifying extent that the vast majority of Cambodia's historic architecture, 95% of Cambodia's Buddhist temples, was completely destroyed.\n\n\n=== Vietnamese occupation and transition, 1978\u20131992 ===\n\nIn November 1978, Vietnamese troops invaded Cambodia in response to border raids by the Khmer Rouge. The People's Republic of Kampuchea (PRK), a pro-Soviet state led by the Kampuchean People's Revolutionary Party, a party created by the Vietnamese in 1951, and led by a group of Khmer Rouge who had fled Cambodia to avoid being purged by Pol Pot and Ta Mok, was established. It was fully beholden to the occupying Vietnamese army and under direction of the Vietnamese ambassador to Phnom Penh. Its arms came from Vietnam and the Soviet Union.In opposition to the newly created state, a government-in-exile referred to as the Coalition Government of Democratic Kampuchea (CGDK) was formed in 1981 from three factions. This consisted of the Khmer Rouge, a royalist faction led by Sihanouk, and the Khmer People's National Liberation Front. Its credentials were recognised by the United Nations. The Khmer Rouge representative to the UN, Thiounn Prasith, was retained, but he had to work in consultation with representatives of the noncommunist Cambodian parties. The refusal of Vietnam to withdraw from Cambodia led to economic sanctions by the US and its allies.\n\nPeace efforts began in Paris in 1989 under the State of Cambodia, culminating two years later in October 1991 in a Paris Comprehensive Peace Settlement. The UN was given a mandate to enforce a ceasefire and deal with refugees and disarmament known as the United Nations Transitional Authority in Cambodia (UNTAC).\n\n\n=== Restoration of the monarchy ===\nIn 1993, Norodom Sihanouk was restored as King of Cambodia, but all power was in the hands of the government established after the UNTAC sponsored elections. The stability established following the conflict was shaken in 1997 by a coup d'\u00e9tat led by the co-Prime Minister Hun Sen against the non-communist parties in the government. After its government was able to stabilize under Sen, Cambodia was accepted into the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) on 30 April 1999. In recent years, reconstruction efforts have progressed and led to some political stability through a multiparty democracy under a constitutional monarchy. Although Sen's rule has been marred by human rights abuses and corruption, most Cambodian citizens through the 2000s maintained approval of the government; interviews with rural Cambodians in 2008 displayed a preference for a stable status quo over potentially violent change.In July 2010, Kang Kek Iew was the first Khmer Rouge member found guilty of war crimes and crimes against humanity in his role as the former commandant of the S21 extermination camp and he was sentenced to life in prison. However, Hun Sen has opposed extensive trials of former Khmer Rouge mass murderers.In August 2014, a UN-backed war crimes tribunal, the Extraordinary Chambers in the Courts of Cambodia (also known as the Khmer Rouge Tribunal), sentenced Khieu Samphan, the regime's 83-year-old former head of state, and Nuon Chea, its 88-year-old chief ideologue, to life in prison on war crimes charges for their role in the country's terror period in the 1970s. The trial began in November 2011. Former Foreign Minister Ieng Sary died in 2013, while his wife, Social Affairs Minister Ieng Thirith, was deemed unfit to stand trial due to dementia in 2012.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\nCambodia has an area of 181,035 square kilometres (69,898 square miles) and lies entirely within the tropics, between latitudes 10\u00b0 and 15\u00b0N, and longitudes 102\u00b0 and 108\u00b0E. It borders Thailand to the north and west, Laos to the northeast, and Vietnam to the east and southeast. It has a 443-kilometre (275-mile) coastline along the Gulf of Thailand.Cambodia's landscape is characterised by a low-lying central plain that is surrounded by uplands and low mountains and includes the Tonle Sap (Great Lake) and the upper reaches of the Mekong River delta. Extending outward from this central region are transitional plains, thinly forested and rising to elevations of about 650 feet (200 metres) above sea level.\nTo the north the Cambodian plain abuts a sandstone escarpment, which forms a southward-facing cliff stretching more than 200 miles (320 kilometres) from west to east and rising abruptly above the plain to heights of 600 to 1,800 feet (180\u2013550 metres). This cliff marks the southern limit of the D\u00e2ngr\u00eak Mountains.\nFlowing south through Cambodia's eastern regions is the Mekong River. East of the Mekong the transitional plains gradually merge with the eastern highlands, a region of forested mountains and high plateaus that extend into Laos and Vietnam. In southwestern Cambodia two distinct upland blocks, the Kr\u00e2vanh Mountains and the D\u00e2mrei Mountains, form another highland region that covers much of the land area between the Tonle Sap and the Gulf of Thailand.\nIn this remote and largely uninhabited area, Phnom Aural, Cambodia's highest peak rises to an elevation of 5,949 feet (1,813 metres). The southern coastal region adjoining the Gulf of Thailand is a narrow lowland strip, heavily wooded and sparsely populated, which is isolated from the central plain by the southwestern highlands.\nThe most distinctive geographical feature is the inundations of the Tonle Sap, measuring about 2,590 square kilometres (1,000 square miles) during the dry season and expanding to about 24,605 square kilometres (9,500 square miles) during the rainy season. This densely populated plain, which is devoted to wet rice cultivation, is the heartland of Cambodia. Much of this area has been designated as a biosphere reserve.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\n\nCambodia's climate, like that of the rest of Southeast Asia, is dominated by monsoons, which are known as tropical wet and dry because of the distinctly marked seasonal differences.\nCambodia has a temperature range from 21 to 35 \u00b0C (70 to 95 \u00b0F) and experiences tropical monsoons. Southwest monsoons blow inland bringing moisture-laden winds from the Gulf of Thailand and Indian Ocean from May to October. The northeast monsoon ushers in the dry season, which lasts from November to April. The country experiences the heaviest precipitation from September to October with the driest period occurring from January to February.\nAccording to the International Development Research Center and The United Nations, Cambodia is considered Southeast Asia's most vulnerable country to the effects of climate change, alongside the Philippines. Nearly all provinces in Cambodia are affected by climate change. Rural coastal populations are particularly at risk. Shortages of clean water, extreme flooding, mudslides, higher sea levels and potentially destructive storms are of particular concern, according to the Cambodia Climate Change Alliance.\nCambodia has two distinct seasons. The rainy season, which runs from May to October, can see temperatures drop to 22 \u00b0C (72 \u00b0F) and is generally accompanied with high humidity. The dry season lasts from November to April when temperatures can rise up to 40 \u00b0C (104 \u00b0F) around April. Disastrous flooding occurred in 2001 and again in 2002, with some degree of flooding almost every year.\n\n\n=== Ecology ===\n\nCambodia's biodiversity is largely founded on its seasonal tropical forests, containing some 180 recorded tree species, and riparian ecosystems. There are 212 mammal species, 536 bird species, 240 reptile species, 850 freshwater fish species (Tonle Sap Lake area), and 435 marine fish species recorded by science. Much of this biodiversity is contained around the Tonle Sap Lake and the surrounding biosphere.The Tonle Sap Biosphere Reserve is a reserve surrounding the Tonle Sap lake. It encompasses the lake and nine provinces: Kampong Thom, Siem Reap, Battambang, Pursat, Kampong Chhnang, Banteay Meanchey, Pailin, Oddar Meanchey and Preah Vihear. In 1997, it was successfully nominated as a UNESCO Biosphere Reserve. Other key habitats include the evergreen and dry Dipterocarp forests of Mondolkiri province, protected by Keo Seima Wildlife Sanctuary, Phnom Prich Wildlife Sanctuary, and Srepok Wildlife Sanctuary, as well as Ratanakiri province, and the Cardamom Mountains ecosystem, including Preah Monivong National Park, Botum-Sakor National Park, and the Phnom Aural Wildlife Sanctuary and  Phnom Samkos Wildlife Sanctuary.\nThe Worldwide Fund for Nature recognises six distinct terrestrial ecoregions in Cambodia \u2013 the Cardamom Mountains rain forests, Central Indochina dry forest, Southeast Indochina dry evergreen forest, Southern Annamite Range tropical forest, Tonle Sap freshwater swamp forest, and Tonle Sap-Mekong peat swamp forest.\n\n\n=== Environment ===\n\nCambodia has a bad but improving performance in the global Environmental Performance Index (EPI) with an overall ranking of 146 out of 180 countries in 2016. This is among the worst in the Southeast Asian region, only ahead of Laos and Myanmar. The EPI was established in 2001 by the World Economic Forum as a global gauge to measure how well individual countries perform in implementing the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals.\nThe environmental areas where Cambodia performs worst (i.e. highest ranking) are air quality (148), water resource management (140) and health impacts of environmental issues (137), with the areas of sanitation, environmental impacts of fisheries and forest management following closely. Cambodia performs best when it comes to handling the nitrogen balance in the agricultural industry specifically, an area where Cambodia excels and are among the best in the world. In addition, Cambodia has an unusually large area of wildlife protections, both on land and at sea, with the land-based protections covering about 20% of the country. This secures Cambodia a better than average ranking of 61 in relation to biodiversity and habitat, even though illegal logging, construction and poaching are heavily deteriorating these protections and habitats in reality.\n\nThe rate of deforestation in Cambodia is one of the highest in the world and it is often perceived as the most destructive, singular environmental issue in the country. Cambodia's primary forest cover fell from over 70% in 1969 to just 3.1% in 2007. In total, Cambodia lost 25,000 km2 (9,700 sq mi) of forest between 1990 and 2005 \u2013 3,340 km2 (1,290 sq mi) of which was primary forest. Since 2007, less than 3,220 km2 (1,243 sq mi) of primary forest remain with the result that the future sustainability of the forest reserves of Cambodia is under severe threat.In 2010\u20132015, the annual rate of deforestation was 1.3%. The environmental degradation also includes national parks and wildlife sanctuaries on a large scale and many endangered and endemic species are now threatened with extinction due to loss of habitats. There are many reasons for the deforestation in Cambodia, which range from opportunistic illegal loggings to large scale clearings from big construction projects and agricultural activities. The global issue of land grabbing is particularly rampant in Cambodia. The deforestation involves the local population, Cambodian businesses and authorities as well as transnational corporations from all over the world.Plans for hydroelectric development in the Greater Mekong Subregion, by Laos in particular, pose a \"real danger to the food supply of Vietnam and Cambodia. Upstream dams will imperil the fish stocks that provide the vast majority of Cambodia's protein and could also denude the Mekong River of the silt Vietnam needs for its rice basket.\"\nThe rich fisheries of Tonle Sap, the largest freshwater lake in Southeast Asia, largely supply the impoverished country's protein. The lake is unusual: It all but disappears in the dry season and then expands massively as water flow from the Mekong backs up when the rains come. \"Those fish are so important for their livelihoods, both economically and nutritionally\", said Gordon Holtgrieve, a professor at the University of Washington who researches Cambodia's freshwater fish and he points out that none of the dams that are either built or being built on the Mekong river \"are pointing at good outcomes for the fisheries\".In the 2010s, the Cambodian government and educational system has increased its involvement and co-operation with both national and international environmental groups. A new National Environmental Strategy and Action Plan (NESAP) for Cambodia is to be implemented from late 2016 to 2023 and contains new ideas for how to incite a green and environmentally sustainable growth for the country.In November 2017, the U.S. cut funds to help clear unexploded ordnance including land mines and chemical weapons in Cambodia which it had dropped during the Vietnam War.\n\n\n== Politics ==\n\n\n=== Government ===\n\nNational politics in Cambodia take place within the framework of the nation's constitution of 1993. The government is a constitutional monarchy operated as a parliamentary representative democracy. The Prime Minister of Cambodia, an office held by Hun Sen since 1985, is the head of government, while the King of Cambodia (currently Norodom Sihamoni) is the head of state. The prime minister is appointed by the king, on the advice and with the approval of the National Assembly. The prime minister and the ministerial appointees exercise executive power.\nLegislative powers are shared by the executive and the bicameral Parliament of Cambodia (\u179f\u1797\u17b6\u178f\u17c6\u178e\u17b6\u1784\u179a\u17b6\u179f\u17d2\u178f\u17d2\u179a, saphea damnang reastr), which consists of a lower house, the National Assembly (\u179a\u178a\u17d2\u178b\u179f\u1797\u17b6, rotsaphea) and an upper house, the Senate (\u1796\u17d2\u179a\u17b9\u1791\u17d2\u1792\u179f\u1797\u17b6, protsaphea). Members of the 123-seat Assembly are elected through a system of proportional representation and serve for a maximum term of five years. The Senate has 61 seats, two of which are appointed by the king and two others by the National Assembly, and the rest elected by the commune councillors from 24 provinces of Cambodia. Senators serve six-year terms.On 14 October 2004, King Norodom Sihamoni was selected by a special nine-member Royal Throne Council, part of a selection process that was quickly put in place after the abdication of King Norodom Sihanouk a week prior. Sihamoni's selection was endorsed by Prime Minister Hun Sen and National Assembly Speaker Prince Norodom Ranariddh (the king's half-brother and current chief advisor), both members of the throne council. He was enthroned in Phnom Penh on 29 October 2004.\nOfficially a multiparty democracy, in reality \"the country remains a one-party state dominated by the Cambodian People's Party and Prime Minister Hun Sen, a recast Khmer Rouge official in power since 1985. The open doors to new investment during his reign have yielded the most access to a coterie of cronies of his and his wife, Bun Rany.\" Cambodia's government has been described by the Human Rights Watch's Southeast Asian director, David Roberts, as a \"relatively authoritarian coalition via a superficial democracy\".Prime Minister Hun Sen has vowed to rule until he is 74. He is a former Khmer Rouge member who defected. His government is regularly accused of ignoring human rights and suppressing political dissent. The 2013 election results were disputed by Hun Sen's opposition, leading to demonstrations in the capital. Demonstrators were injured and killed in Phnom Penh where a reported 20,000 protesters gathered, with some clashing with riot police. From a humble farming background, Hun Sen was just 33 when he took power in 1985, and is by some considered a long ruling dictator.Since the 2017 crackdowns on political dissent and free press, Cambodia has been described as a de facto one-party state.\n\n\n=== Political culture ===\n\nThe Cambodian People's Party (CPP) is the sole dominant-party in Cambodia. Since 2018, the CPP commands all but four seats in Parliament, including all 125 seats in the National Assembly and 58 of 62 seats in the Senate.\n\nHun Sen and his government have seen much controversy. Hun Sen was a former Khmer Rouge commander who was originally installed by the Vietnamese and, after the Vietnamese left the country, maintains his strong man position by violence and oppression when deemed necessary. In 1997, fearing the growing power of his co\u2013prime minister, Prince Norodom Ranariddh, Hun launched a coup, using the army to purge Ranariddh and his supporters. Ranariddh was ousted and fled to Paris while other opponents of Hun Sen were arrested, tortured, and some summarily executed.In addition to political oppression, the Cambodian government has been accused of corruption in the sale of vast areas of land to foreign investors resulting in the eviction of thousands of villagers as well as taking bribes in exchange for grants to exploit Cambodia's oil wealth and mineral resources. Cambodia is consistently listed as one of the most corrupt governments in the world. Amnesty International currently recognises one prisoner of conscience in the country: 33-year-old land rights activist Yorm Bopha.Journalists covering a protest over disputed election results in Phnom Penh on 22 September 2013 say they were deliberately attacked by police and men in plain clothes, with slingshots and stun guns. The attack against the president of the Overseas Press Club of Cambodia, Rick Valenzuela, was captured on video.\nThe violence came amid political tensions as the opposition boycotted the opening of Parliament due to concerns about electoral fraud. Seven reporters sustained minor injuries while at least two Cambodian protesters were hit by slingshot projectiles and hospitalized.In 2017 the Cambodia's Supreme Court dissolved the main opposition party, Cambodia National Rescue Party (CNRP), paving the way for a return to a yet more authoritarian political system.\n\n\n=== Corruption ===\n\nThe level of corruption in Cambodia exceeds most countries in the world. Despite adopting an 'Anti-Corruption Law' in 2010, corruption prevails throughout the country. Corruption affects the judiciary, the police and other state institutions. Favouritism by government officials and impunity is commonplace. Lack of a clear distinction between the courts and the executive branch of government also makes for a deep politicisation of the judicial system.Examples of areas where Cambodians encounter corrupt practices in their everyday lives include obtaining medical services, dealing with alleged traffic violations, and pursuing fair court verdicts. Companies deal with extensive red tape when obtaining licenses and permits, especially construction related permits, and the demand for and supply of bribes are commonplace in this process. The 2010 Anti-Corruption Law provided no protection to whistle-blowers, and whistle-blowers can be jailed for up to 6 months if they report corruption that cannot be proven.\n\n\n=== Foreign relations ===\n\nThe foreign relations of Cambodia are handled by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs under Prak Sokhon. Cambodia is a member of the United Nations, the World Bank, and the International Monetary Fund. It is a member of the Asian Development Bank (ADB), ASEAN, and joined the WTO in 2004. In 2005 Cambodia attended the inaugural East Asia Summit in Malaysia.\nCambodia has established diplomatic relations with numerous countries; the government reports twenty embassies in the country including many of its Asian neighbours and those of important players during the Paris peace negotiations, including the US, Australia, Canada, China, the European Union (EU), Japan, and Russia. As a result of its international relations, various charitable organisations have assisted with social, economic, and civil infrastructure needs.\n\nWhile the violent ruptures of the 1970s and 1980s have passed, several border disputes between Cambodia and its neighbours persist. There are disagreements over some offshore islands and sections of the boundary with Vietnam and undefined maritime boundaries. Cambodia and Thailand also have border disputes, with troops clashing over land immediately adjacent to the Preah Vihear temple in particular, leading to a deterioration in relations. Most of the territory belongs to Cambodia, but a combination of Thailand disrespecting international law, Thai troop upbuild in the area and lack of resources for the Cambodian military have left the situation unsettled since 1962.Cambodia and China have cultivated ties in the 2010s. A Chinese company with the support of the People's Liberation Army built a deep-water seaport along 90 km (56 mi) stretch of Cambodian coastline of the Gulf of Thailand in Koh Kong province; the port is sufficiently deep to be used by cruise ships, bulk carriers or warships. Cambodia's diplomatic support has been invaluable to Beijing's effort to claim disputed areas in the South China Sea. Because Cambodia is a member of ASEAN, and because under ASEAN rules \"the objections of one member can thwart any group initiative\", Cambodia is diplomatically useful to China as a counterweight to southeast Asian nations that have closer ties to the United States.\n\n\n=== Military ===\n\nThe Royal Cambodian Army, Royal Cambodian Navy, Royal Cambodian Air Force and Royal Gendarmerie collectively form the Royal Cambodian Armed Forces, under the command of the Ministry of National Defence, presided over by the Prime Minister of Cambodia. His Majesty King Norodom Sihamoni is the Supreme Commander of the Royal Cambodian Armed Forces (RCAF), and the country's Prime Minister Hun Sen effectively holds the position of commander-in-chief.\nThe introduction of a revised command structure early in 2000 was a key prelude to the reorganisation of the Cambodian military. This saw the defence ministry form three subordinate general departments responsible for logistics and finance, materials and technical services, and defence services under the High Command Headquarters (HCHQ).\nThe minister of National Defense is General Tea Banh. Banh has served as defence minister since 1979. The Secretaries of State for Defense are Chay Saing Yun and Por Bun Sreu.\nIn 2010, the Royal Cambodian Armed Forces comprised about 102,000 active personnel (200,000 reserve). Total Cambodian military spending stands at 3% of national GDP. The Royal Gendarmerie of Cambodia total more than 7,000 personnel. Its civil duties include providing security and public peace, to investigate and prevent organised crime, terrorism and other violent groups; to protect state and private property; to help and assist civilians and other emergency forces in a case of emergency, natural disaster, civil unrest and armed conflicts.\nHun Sen has accumulated highly centralised power in Cambodia, including a praetorian guard that 'appears to rival the capabilities of the country's regular military units', and is allegedly used by Hun Sen to quell political opposition.' Cambodia signed the UN treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons.\n\n\n=== Legal profession ===\nThe Cambodian legal profession was established in 1932. By 1978, due to the Khmer Rouge regime, the entire legal system was eradicated. Judges and lawyers were executed after being deemed \"class enemies\" and only 6\u201312 legal professionals actually survived and remained in the country. Lawyers did not reappear until 1995 when the Bar Association of the Kingdom of Cambodia was created.\n\n\n=== Human rights ===\n\n \nA US State Department report says \"forces under Hun Sen and the Cambodian People's Party have committed frequent and large-scale abuses, including extrajudicial killings and torture, with impunity\". According to the 2016 Global Slavery Index, an estimated 256,800 people are enslaved in modern-day Cambodia, or 1.65% of the population.Forced land evictions by senior officials, security forces, and government-connected business leaders are commonplace in Cambodia. Land has been confiscated from hundreds of thousands of Cambodians over more than a decade for the purpose of self-enrichment and maintaining power of various groups of special interests. Credible non-governmental organisations estimate that \"770,000 people have been adversely affected by land grabbing covering at least four million hectares (nearly 10 million acres) of land that have been confiscated\", says Paris-based International Federation for Human Rights (FIDH).On 14 March 2018, the UN expert on the human rights situation in Cambodia \"expressed serious concerns about restrictions on the media, freedom of expression and political participation ahead of a national election in July\". Some critics of the government have been arrested for allegedly spreading fake news about the COVID-19 pandemic in Cambodia.\n\n\n=== Administrative divisions ===\n\nThe autonomous municipality (reach thani) and provinces (khaet) of Cambodia are first-level administrative divisions. Cambodia is divided into 25 provinces including the autonomous municipality.\nMunicipalities and districts are the second-level administrative divisions of Cambodia. The provinces are subdivided into 159 districts and 26 municipalities. The districts and municipalities in turn are further divided into communes (khum) and quarters (sangkat).\n\n\n== Economy ==\n\nIn 2017 Cambodia's per capita income is $4,022 in PPP and $1,309 in nominal per capita. The United Nations designates Cambodia as a least developed country. Most rural households depend on agriculture and its related sub-sectors. Rice, fish, timber, garments and rubber are Cambodia's major exports. The International Rice Research Institute (IRRI) reintroduced more than 750 traditional rice varieties to Cambodia from its rice seed bank in the Philippines. These varieties had been collected in the 1960s.\nBased on the Economist, IMF: Annual average GDP growth for the period 2001\u20132010 was 7.7% making it one of the world's top ten countries with the highest annual average GDP growth. Tourism was Cambodia's fastest growing industry, with arrivals increasing from 219,000 in 1997 to over 2 million in 2007. In 2004, inflation was at 1.7% and exports at $1.6 billion US$.\n\nIn the Cambodia country assessment \"Where Have All The Poor Gone? Cambodia Poverty Assessment 2013\", the World Bank concludes: \"Over the seven years from 2004 through 2011, Cambodian economic growth was tremendous, ranking amid the best in the world. Moreover, household consumption increased by nearly 40 percent. And this growth was pro-poor\u2014not only reducing inequality, but also proportionally boosting poor people's consumption further and faster than that of the non-poor. As a result, the poverty rate dropped from 52.2 to 20.5 percent, surpassing all expectations and far exceeding the country's Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) poverty target. However, the majority of these people escaped poverty only slightly: they remain highly vulnerable\u2014even to small shocks\u2014which could quickly bring them back into poverty.\"\"Two decades of economic growth have helped make Cambodia a global leader in reducing poverty. The success story means the Southeast Asian nation that overcame a vicious civil war now is classified as a lower-middle income economy by the World Bank Group (WBG). Among 69 countries that have comparable data, Cambodia ranked fourth in terms of the fastest poverty reduction in the world from 2004\u20132008. (See more details of Cambodia's achievements on poverty reduction. The poverty rate fell to 10 percent in 2013, and further reduction of poverty is expected for both urban and rural households throughout 2015\u20132016. However, human development, particularly in the areas of health and education, remains an important challenge and development priority for Cambodia\"Oil and natural gas deposits found beneath Cambodia's territorial waters in 2005 yield great potential but remain mostly untapped, due in part to territorial disputes with Thailand.\n\nThe National Bank of Cambodia is the central bank of the kingdom and provides regulatory oversight to the country's banking sector and is responsible in part for increasing the foreign direct investment in the country. Between 2010 and 2012 the number of regulated banks and micro-finance institutions increased from 31 covered entities to over 70 individual institutions underlining the growth within the Cambodian banking and finance sector.\nIn 2012, Credit Bureau Cambodia was established with direct regulatory oversight by the National Bank of Cambodia. The Credit Bureau further increases the transparency and stability within the Cambodian Banking Sector as all banks and microfinance companies are now required by law to report accurate facts and figures relating to loan performance in the country.\nOne of the largest challenges facing Cambodia is still the fact that the older population often lacks education, particularly in the countryside, which suffers from a lack of basic infrastructure. Fear of renewed political instability and corruption within the government discourage foreign investment and delay foreign aid, although there has been significant aid from bilateral and multilateral donors. Donors pledged $504 million to the country in 2004, while the Asian Development Bank alone has provided $850 million in loans, grants, and technical assistance. Bribes are often demanded from companies operating in Cambodia when obtaining licences and permits, such as construction-related permits.\n\nCambodia ranked among the worst places in the world for organised labour in the 2015 International Trade Union Confederation (ITUC) Global Rights Index, landing in the category of countries with \"no guarantee of rights\".'In April 2016 Cambodia's National Assembly has adopted a Law on Trade Unions. \"The law was proposed at a time when workers have been staging sustained protests in factories and in the streets demanding wage increases and improvements in their working conditions\". The concerns about Cambodia's new law are shared not only by labour and rights groups, but international organisations more generally. The International Labour Organization Country Office for Thailand, Cambodia and Lao PDR, has noted that the law has \"several key concerns and gaps\".Independent unions and employers remain divided. \"How can a factory with 25 unions survive?\" asked Van Sou Ieng, chairman of the Garment Manufacturers Association in Cambodia (GMAC), adding that it was \"incomprehensible to expect an employer to negotiate a dispute with 25 different union leaders. A law was necessary to rein in the country's unions, Van Sou Ieng said. According to GMAC, last year there were 3,166 unions for the more than 500,000 workers employed in the country's 557 garment and textile exporting factories, and 58 footwear factories. Though garment production is already Cambodia's largest industry, which accounts for 26.2 percent of the country's Gross Domestic Product, Van Sou Ieng said without the trade union law, foreign investors will not come to do business\".\n\"Only with the trade union law will we, employers, be able to survive.... not only Cambodia, every country has trade union law. Those who criticise [the law] should do businesses, and [then] they will understand.\"\n\n\n=== Textiles ===\n\nThe garment industry represents the largest portion of Cambodia's manufacturing sector, accounting for 80% of the country's exports. In 2012, the exports grew to $4.61 billion up 8% over 2011. In the first half of 2013, the garment industry reported exports worth $1.56 billion. The sector employs 335,400 workers, of which 91% are female.\nBetter Factories Cambodia was created in 2001 as a unique partnership between the UN's International Labour Organization (ILO) and the International Finance Corporation (IFC), a member of the World Bank Group. The programme engages with workers, employers and governments to improve working conditions and boost competitiveness of the garment industry. On 18 May 2018, the Project Advisory Committee (PAC) of the ILO Better Factories Cambodia Programme met in Phnom Penh to provide input into the draft conclusions and recommendations of the BFC's independent mid-term evaluation, as well as to discuss options on how to further strengthen the programme's transparent reporting initiative.\nThe members of the PAC concurred with the findings of the evaluation related to the impact the programme has had on the Cambodian garment sector and workers, including:\na. contributing to sustained overall growth of the garment industry\nb. improving the lives of at least half a million Cambodian workers of factories in the BFC\nprogramme and many more of their family members;\nc. ensuring that workers receive correct wages and social protection benefits\nd. virtually eliminating child labour in the sector\ne. making Cambodia's garment factories safer overall\nf. creating a \"level playing field\" for labour across garment sector\ng. influencing business practices through (1) using factory data to highlight areas for\nimprovement and (2) being a core part of risk management strategies of international\nbrands/buyers.\n\n\n=== Tourism ===\n\nThe tourism industry is the country's second-greatest source of hard currency after the textile industry. International visitor arrivals in 2018 topped six million, a ten-fold increase since the beginning of the 21st century.Besides Phom Penh and Angkor Wat, other tourist destinations include Sihanoukville in the southwest which has several popular beaches and Battambang in the northwest, both of which are popular stops for backpackers who make up a significant portion of visitors to Cambodia. The area around Kampot and Kep including the Bokor Hill Station are also of interest to visitors. Tourism has increased steadily each year in the relatively stable period since the 1993 UNTAC elections.Most international arrivals in 2018 were Chinese. Tourism receipts exceeded US$4.4 billion in 2018, accounting for almost ten percent of the kingdom's gross national product. The Angkor Wat historical park in Siem Reap Province, the beaches in Sihanoukville, the capital city Phnom Penh, and Cambodia's 150 casinos (up from just 57 in 2014) are the main attractions for foreign tourists.\nCambodia's reputation as a safe destination for tourism however has been hindered by civil and political unrest  and several high-profile examples of serious crime committed against tourists visiting the kingdom.Cambodia's tourist souvenir industry employs a lot of people around the main places of interest. The quantity of souvenirs that are produced is not sufficient to face the increasing number of tourists and a majority of products sold to the tourists on the markets are imported from China, Thailand, and Vietnam. Some of the locally produced souvenirs include:\n\nKrama (traditional scarf)\nCeramics\nSoap, candles, spices\nWood carvings, lacquerware, silver plate\nPainted bottles containing infused rice wine\n\n\n=== Agriculture ===\n\nAgriculture is the mainstay of the Cambodian economy. Agriculture accounted for 90 percent of GDP in 1985 and employed approximately 80 percent of the work force. Rice is the principal commodity. Major secondary crops include maize, cassava, sweet potatoes, groundnuts, soybeans, sesame seeds, dry beans, and rubber. The principal commercial crop is rubber. In the 1980s it was an important primary commodity, second only to rice, and one of the country's few sources of foreign exchange.\n\n\n=== Transport ===\n\nThe civil war and neglect severely damaged Cambodia's transport system. With assistance from other countries Cambodia has been upgrading the main highways to international standards and most are vastly improved from 2006. Most main roads are now paved.\n\nCambodia has two rail lines, totalling about 612 kilometres (380 miles) of single, one-metre (3-foot-3-inch) gauge track. The lines run from the capital to Sihanoukville on the southern coast. Trains are again running to and from the Cambodian capital and popular destinations in the south. After 14 years, regular rail services between the two cities restarted recently \u2013 offering a safer option than road for travellers. Trains also run from Phnom Penh to Sisophon (although trains often run only as far as Battambang). As of 1987, only one passenger train per week operated between Phnom Penh and Battambang but a US$141 million project, funded mostly by the Asian Development Bank, has been started to revitalise the languishing rail system that will \"(interlink) Cambodia with major industrial and logistics centers in Bangkok and Ho Chi Minh City\".Besides the main inter-provincial traffic artery connecting Phnom Penh with Sihanoukville, resurfacing a former dirt road with concrete / asphalt and bridging five major river crossings have now permanently connected Phnom Penh with Koh Kong, and hence there is now uninterrupted road access to neighbouring Thailand and its road network.\n\nCambodia's road traffic accident rate is high by world standards. In 2004, the number of road fatalities per 10,000 vehicles was ten times higher in Cambodia than in the developed world, and the number of road deaths had doubled in the preceding three years.Cambodia's extensive inland waterways were important historically in international trade. The Mekong and the Tonle Sap River, their numerous tributaries, and the Tonle Sap provided avenues of considerable length, including 3,700 kilometres (2,300 miles) navigable all year by craft drawing 0.6 metres (2.0 feet) and another 282 kilometres (175 miles) navigable to craft drawing 1.8 metres (5.9 feet).Cambodia has two major ports, Phnom Penh and Sihanoukville, and five minor ones. Phnom Penh, at the junction of the Bassac, the Mekong, and the Tonle Sap Rivers, is the only river port capable of receiving 8,000-ton ships during the wet season and 5,000-ton ships during the dry season.\nWith increasing economic activity has come an increase in automobile use, though motorcycles still predominate. \"Cyclo\" (as hand-me-down French) or Cycle rickshaws were popular in 1990s but are increasingly replaced by remorques (carriages attached to motorcycles) and rickshaws imported from India. Cyclos are unique to Cambodia in that the cyclist sits behind the passenger seat.Cambodia has three commercial airports. In 2018, they handled a record of 10 million passengers. Phnom Penh International Airport is the busiest airport in Cambodia. Siem Reap-Angkor International Airport is the second busiest, and serves the most international flights in and out of Cambodia. Sihanouk International Airport, is in the coastal city of Sihanoukville.\n\n\n== Society ==\n\n\n=== Demographics ===\n\nFifty percent of the Cambodian population is younger than 22 years old. At a 1.04 female to male ratio, Cambodia has the most female-biased sex ratio in the Greater Mekong Subregion. Among the Cambodian population aged over 65, the female to male ratio is 1.6:1.The total fertility rate in Cambodia was 3.0 children per woman in 2010. The fertility rate was 4.0 children in 2000. Women in urban areas have 2.2 children on average, compared with 3.3 children per woman in rural areas. Fertility is highest in Mondol Kiri and Rattanak Kiri Provinces, where women have an average of 4.5 children, and lowest in Phnom Penh where women have an average of 2.0 children.\n\n\n=== Ethnic groups ===\n\nThe vast majority of Cambodia's population is of ethnic Khmer origin (over 95%) who are speakers of the Khmer language, the country's sole official language. Cambodia's population is largely homogeneous. Its minority groups include Chams (1.2%), Vietnamese (0.1%) and Chinese (0.1%).The largest ethnic group in Cambodia are the Khmers, who comprise around 90% of the total population in Cambodia, and are indigenous to the lowland Mekong subregion in which they inhabit. The Khmers historically have lived near the lower Mekong River in a contiguous diagonal arc, from where modern-day Thailand, Laos and Cambodia meet in the northwest, all the way to the mouth of the Mekong River in southeastern Vietnam.\nThe Vietnamese are the second largest ethnic minority in Cambodia, with an estimated 16,000 living in provinces concentrated in the southeast of the country adjacent to the Mekong Delta. Although the Vietnamese language has been determined to be a Mon\u2013Khmer language, there are very few cultural connections between the two peoples because the early Khmers were influenced by the Indian cultural sphere while the Vietnamese are part of the Chinese cultural sphere. Ethnic tensions between the Khmer and the Vietnamese can be traced to the Post-Angkor Period (from the 16th to 19th centuries), during which time a nascent Vietnam and Thailand each attempted to vassalise a weakened post-Angkor Cambodia, and effectively dominate all of Indochina.Chinese Cambodians are approximately 0.1% of the population. Most Chinese are descended from 19th\u201320th-century settlers who came in search of trade and commerce opportunities during the time of the French protectorate. Most are urban dwellers, engaged primarily in commerce.\nThe indigenous ethnic groups of the mountains are known collectively as Montagnards or Khmer Loeu, a term meaning \"Highland Khmer\". They are descended from neolithic migrations of Mon\u2013Khmer speakers via southern China and Austronesian speakers from insular Southeast Asia. Being isolated in the highlands, the various Khmer Loeu groups were not Indianized like their Khmer cousins and consequently are culturally distant from modern Khmers and often from each other, observing many pre-Indian-contact customs and beliefs.\nThe Cham are descended from the Austronesian people of Champa, a former kingdom on the coast of central and southern present-day Vietnam and former rival to the Khmer Empire. The Cham in Cambodia number under a million and often maintain separate villages in the southeast of the country. Almost all Cham in Cambodia are Muslims.\n\n\n=== Population centres ===\n\n\n=== Languages ===\n\nThe Khmer language is a member of the Mon\u2013Khmer subfamily of the Austroasiatic language group. French, once the language of government in Indochina, is still spoken by many older Cambodians, and is also the language of instruction in some schools and universities that are funded by the government of France. There is also a French-language newspaper and some TV channels are available in French. Cambodia is a member of La Francophonie. Cambodian French, a remnant of the country's colonial past, is a dialect found in Cambodia and is sometimes used in government, particularly in court. Since 1993, there has been a growing use of English, which has been replacing French as the main foreign language. English is widely taught in several universities and there is also a significant press in that language, while street signs are now bilingual in Khmer and English. Due to this shift, English is now mostly used in Cambodia's international relationships and has replaced French both in Cambodia's stamps, since 2002, and currency.The Khmer script is derived from the South Indian Pallava script.\n\n\n=== Religion ===\n\nTheravada Buddhism is the official religion of Cambodia, practised by more than 95 percent of the population with an estimated 4,392 monastery temples throughout the country. Cambodian Buddhism is deeply influenced by Hinduism and native animism.\nThe close interrelationship between spirits and the community, the efficacy of apotropaic and luck-attracting actions and charms, and the possibility of manipulating one's life through contact with spiritual entities such as the \"baromey\" spirits originates from the native folk religion. Hinduism has left little trace beyond the magical practices of Tantricism and a host of Hindu gods now assimilated into the spirit world (for example, the important neak ta spirit called Yeay Mao is the modern avatar of the Hindu goddess Kali).\nMahayana Buddhism is the religion of the majority of Chinese and Vietnamese in Cambodia. Elements of other religious practices, such as the veneration of folk heroes and ancestors, Confucianism, and Taoism mix with Chinese Buddhism are also practised.\nIslam is followed by about 2% of the population and comes in three varieties, two practised by the Cham people and a third by the descendants of Malays, resident in the country for generations. Cambodia's Muslim population is reported to be 80% ethnic Cham.\n\n\n=== Health ===\n\nCambodian life expectancy was 72 years in 2014, a major improvement since 1995 when the average life expectancy was 55. Health care is offered by both public and private practitioners and research has found that trust in health providers is a key factor in improving the uptake of health care services in rural Cambodia. The government plans to increase the quality of healthcare in the country by raising awareness of HIV/AIDS, malaria, and other diseases.\nCambodia's infant mortality rate has decreased from 115 per 1,000 live births in 1993 to 54 in 2009. In the same period, the under-five mortality rate decreased from 181 to 115 per 1,000 live births. In the province with worst health indicators, Ratanakiri, 22.9% of children die before age five.Cambodia was once one of the most landmined countries in the world. According to some estimates, unexploded land mines have been responsible for over 60,000 civilian deaths and thousands more maimed or injured since 1970. The number of reported landmine casualties has sharply decreased, from 800 in 2005 to 111 in 2013 (22 dead and 89 injured). Adults that survive landmines often require amputation of one or more limbs and have to resort to begging for survival. Cambodia is expected to be free of land mines by 2020 but the social and economic legacy, including orphans and one in 290 people being an amputee, is expected to affect Cambodia for years to come.\nIn Cambodia, landmines and exploded ordnance alone have caused 44,630 injuries between 1979 and 2013, according to the Cambodia Mine/UXO Victim Information System.\n\n\n=== Education ===\n\nThe Ministry of Education, Youth and Sports is responsible for establishing national policies and guidelines for education in Cambodia. The Cambodian education system is heavily decentralised, with three levels of government, central, provincial and district \u2013 responsible for its management. The constitution of Cambodia promulgates free compulsory education for nine years, guaranteeing the universal right to basic quality education.\n\nThe 2008 Cambodian census estimated that 77.6% of the population was literate (85.1% of men and 70.9% of women). Male youth age (15\u201324 years) have a literacy rate of 89% compared to 86% for females.The education system in Cambodia continues to face many challenges, but during the past years there have been significant improvements, especially in terms of primary net enrolment gains, the introduction of program based-budgeting, and the development of a policy framework which helps disadvantaged children to gain access to education. The country has also significantly invested in vocational education, especially in rural areas, to tackle poverty and unemployment.\n Two of Cambodia's most acclaimed universities are based in Phnom Penh.\nTraditionally, education in Cambodia was offered by the wats (Buddhist temples), thus providing education exclusively for the male population. During the Khmer Rouge regime, education suffered significant setbacks. Education has also suffered setbacks from child labour, A study by Kim (2011) reports that most employed children in Cambodia are enrolled in school but their employment is associated with late school entry, negative impacts on their learning outcomes, and increased drop out rates.With respects to academic performance among Cambodian primary school children, research showed that parental attitudes and beliefs played a significant role. Specifically, the study found that poorer academic achievement among children were associated with parents holding stronger fatalistic beliefs (i.e., human strength cannot change destiny). The study further found that \"length of residence\" of parents in the community in which they stay predicted better academic achievement among their children. Overall, the study pointed out to the role of social capital in educational performance and access in the Cambodian society in which family attitudes and beliefs are central to the findings.\n\n\n=== Crime ===\n\nIn 2012, Cambodia had a murder rate of 6.5 per 100,000 population. On a national level, there were a total of 964 murders reported in 2012.Prostitution is illegal in Cambodia but yet appears to be prevalent. In a series of 1993 interviews of women about prostitution, three quarters of the interviewees found being a prostitute to be a norm and a profession they felt was not shameful having. That same year, it was estimated that there were about 100,000 sex workers in Cambodia.On 18 August, Prime Minister Hun Sen signed a directive banning the Finance Ministry from issuing new online gambling licenses, while operators currently holding online licenses would only be allowed to continue operating until those licenses expire. The directive cited the fact that \"some foreigners have used this form of gambling to cheat victims inside and outside the country\" as justifying the new policy. Cambodia had issued over 150 such licenses before the new policy was announced.\n\n\n== Culture ==\n\nVarious factors contribute to the Cambodian culture including Theravada Buddhism, Hinduism, French colonialism, Angkorian culture, and modern globalization. The Cambodian Ministry of Culture and Fine Arts is responsible for promoting and developing Cambodian culture. Cambodian culture not only includes the culture of the lowland ethnic majority, but also some 20 culturally distinct hill tribes colloquially known as the Khmer Loeu, a term coined by Norodom Sihanouk to encourage unity between the highlanders and lowlanders.\nRural Cambodians wear a krama scarf which is a unique aspect of Cambodian clothing. The sampeah is a traditional Cambodian greeting or a way of showing respect to others. Khmer culture, as developed and spread by the Khmer empire, has distinctive styles of dance, architecture and sculpture, which have been exchanged with neighbouring Laos and Thailand throughout history. Angkor Wat (Angkor means \"city\" and Wat \"temple\") is the best preserved example of Khmer architecture from the Angkorian era along with hundreds of other temples that have been discovered in and around the region.\nTraditionally, the Khmer people have a recorded information on Tra leaves. Tra leaf books record legends of the Khmer people, the Ramayana, the origin of Buddhism and other prayer books. They are taken care of by wrapping in cloth to protect from moisture and the climate.Bon Om Tuuk (Festival of Boat Racing), the annual boat rowing contest, is the most attended Cambodian national festival. Held at the end of the rainy season when the Mekong river begins to sink back to its normal levels allowing the Tonle Sap River to reverse flow, approximately 10% of Cambodia's population attends this event each year to play games, give thanks to the moon, watch fireworks, dine, and attend the boat race in a carnival-type atmosphere.Popular games include soccer, kicking a sey, which is similar to a footbag, and chess. Based on the classical Indian solar calendar and Theravada Buddhism, the Cambodian New Year is a major holiday that takes place in April. Recent artistic figures include singers Sinn Sisamouth and Ros Serey Sothea (and later Meng Keo Pichenda), who introduced new musical styles to the country.\nEvery year, Cambodians visit pagodas across the country to mark the 'Festival of the Dead' or Pchum Ben. During the 15-day festival, people offer prayers and food to the spirits of their dead relatives. For most of the Cambodians, it is a time to remember their relatives, who died during 1975-1979 Khmer Rouge regime.\n\n\n=== Cuisine ===\n\nRice is the staple grain, as in other Southeast Asian countries. Fish from the Mekong and Tonle Sap rivers is also an important part of the diet. The supply of fish and fish products for food and trade as of 2000 was 20 kilograms (44 pounds) per person or 2 ounces per day per person. Some of the fish can be made into prahok for longer storage.\nThe cuisine of Cambodia contains tropical fruits, soups and noodles. Key ingredients are kaffir lime, lemon grass, garlic, fish sauce, soy sauce, curry, tamarind, ginger, oyster sauce, coconut milk and black pepper. Some delicacies are \u1793\u17c6\u1794\u1789\u17d2\u1785\u17bb\u1780 (Num Banh chok), \u17a2\u17b6\u1798\u17c9\u17bb\u1780 (Amok), \u17a2\u17b6\u1796\u17b8\u1784 (Ah Ping). The country also boasts various distinct local street foods, such as fried spiders.\nFrench influence on Cambodian cuisine includes the Cambodian red curry with toasted baguette bread. The toasted baguette pieces are dipped in the curry and eaten. Cambodian red curry is also eaten with rice and rice vermicelli noodles. Probably the most popular dine out dish, kuy teav, is a pork broth rice noodle soup with fried garlic, scallions, green onions that may also contain various toppings such as beef balls, shrimp, pork liver or lettuce. Kampot pepper is reputed to be the best in the world and accompanies crab at the Kep crab shacks and squid in the restaurants on the Ou Trojak Jet river. The cuisine is relatively unknown to the world compared to that of its neighbours Thailand and Vietnam.\n\n\n=== Drinks ===\nCambodians drink plenty of tea, grown in Mondulkiri Province and around Kirirom. tai krolap is a strong tea, made by putting water and a mass of tea leaves into a small glass, placing a saucer on top, and turning the whole thing upside down to brew. When it's dark enough, the tea is decanted into another cup and plenty of sugar added, but no milk. Lemon tea tai kdao kroich chhmaa, made with Chinese red-dust tea and lemon juice, is refreshing both hot and iced, and is generally served with a hefty dose of sugar.Regarding coffee, the beans are generally imported from Laos and Vietnam \u2013 although domestically produced coffee from Ratanakiri Province and Mondulkiri Province can be found in some places. Beans are traditionally roasted with butter and sugar, plus various other ingredients that might include anything from rum to pork fat, giving the beverage a strange, sometimes faintly chocolatey aroma.Cambodia has several industrial breweries, located mainly in Sihanoukville Province and Phnom Penh. There are also a growing number of microbreweries in Phnom Penh and Siem Reap. Between 2014 and 2018, the number of craft beer breweries rose from two to nine. As of 2019, there are 12 brewpubs or microbreweries in Cambodia.Rice wine is a popular alcoholic drink. Its quality varies widely and it is often infused with fruits or medicinal herbs. When prepared with macerated fruits or spices, like the Sombai liqueur, it is called sraa tram (or soaked wine) and has gained more and more popularity with the development of tourism as it is smoother to drink than plain rice wine.\n\n\n=== Women ===\n\nKhmer women are traditionally expected to be modest, soft-spoken, well-mannered, industrious, act as the family's caregivers and caretakers and financial controllers, maintain their virginity until marriage, become faithful wives, and act as advisors to their husbands. The \"light\" walking and refinement of Cambodian women is further described as being \"quiet in [...] movements that one cannot hear the sound of their silk skirt rustling\". As financial controllers, the women of Cambodia can be identified as having household authority at the familial level.\n\n\n=== Sports ===\n\nFootball (soccer) is one of the most popular sports, although professional organised sports are not as prevalent in Cambodia as in western countries because of the economic conditions. Soccer was brought to Cambodia by the French and became popular with the locals. The Cambodia national football team managed fourth in the 1972 Asian Cup, but development has slowed since the civil war.\nWestern sports such as basketball, volleyball, bodybuilding, field hockey, rugby union, golf, and baseball are gaining popularity. Volleyball is by far the most popular sport in the country. Native sports include traditional boat racing, buffalo racing, Pradal Serey, Khmer traditional wrestling and Bokator. Cambodia first participated in the Olympics during the 1956 Summer Olympic Games sending equestrian riders. Cambodia also hosted the GANEFO Games, the alternative to the Olympics, in the 1960s.\n\n\n=== Dance ===\n\nCambodian dance can be divided into three main categories: Khmer classical dance, folk dance, and social dances. The exact origins of Khmer classical dance are disputed. Most native Khmer scholars trace modern dance forms back to the time of Angkor, seeing similarities in the temple engravings of the period, while others hold that modern Khmer dance styles were learned (or re-learned) from Siamese court dancers in the 1800s.\nKhmer classical dance is the form of stylised performance art established in the royal courts of Cambodia exhibited for both entertainment and ceremonial purposes. The dances are performed by intricately costumed, highly trained men and women on public occasions for tribute, invocation or to enact traditional stories and epic poems such as Reamker, the Khmer version of the Ramayana. Known formally as Robam Preah Reach Trop (\u179a\u1794\u17b6\u17c6\u1796\u17d2\u179a\u17c7\u179a\u17b6\u1787\u1791\u17d2\u179a\u1796\u17d2\u1799 \"theater of royal wealth\") it is set to the music of a pinpeat ensemble accompanied by a vocal chorus.\nCambodian folk dance, often performed to mahori music, celebrates the various cultural and ethnic groups of Cambodia. Folk dances originated in the villages and are performed, for the most part, by the villagers for the villagers. The movements are less stylised and the clothing worn is that of the people the dancers are portraying, such as hill tribes, Chams or farmers. Typically faster-paced than classical dance, folk dances display themes of the \"common person\" such as love, comedy or warding off evil spirits.Social dances are those performed by guests at banquets, parties or other informal social gatherings. Khmer traditional social dances are analogous to those of other Southeast Asian nations. Examples include the circle dances Romvong and Romkbach as well as Saravan and Lam Leav. Modern western popular dances including Cha-cha, Bolero, and the Madison, have also influenced Cambodian social dance.\n\n\n=== Music ===\n\nTraditional Cambodian music dates back as far as the Khmer Empire. Royal dances like the Apsara Dance are icons of the Cambodian culture as are the Mahori ensembles that accompany them. More rural forms of music include Chapei and A Yai. The former is popular among the older generation and is most often a solo performance of a man plucking a Cambodian guitar (chapei) in between a cappella verses. The lyrics usually have moral or religious theme.\nA Yai can be performed solo or by a man and woman and is often comedic in nature. It is a form of lyrical poetry, often full of double entendres, that can be either scripted or completely impromptu and ad-libbed. When sung by a duo, the man and women take turns, \"answering\" the other's verse or posing riddles for the other to solve, with short instrumental breaks in between verses. Pleng kaah (lit. \"wedding music\") is a set of traditional music and songs played both for entertainment and as accompaniment for the various ceremonial parts of a traditional, days-long Khmer wedding.\nCambodian popular music is performed with western style instruments or a mixture of traditional and western instruments. Dance music is composed in particular styles for social dances. The music of crooner Sinn Sisamouth and Ros Sereysothea from the 1960s to the 1970s is considered to be the classic pop music of Cambodia. During the Khmer Rouge Revolution, many classic and popular singers of the 1960s and 1970s were murdered, starved to death, or overwork to death by the Khmer Rouge. and many original master tapes from the period were lost or destroyed.\nIn the 1980s, Keo Surath, (a refugee resettled in the United States) and others carried on the legacy of the classic singers, often remaking their popular songs. The 1980s and 1990s also saw the rise in popularity of kantrum, a music style of the Khmer Surin set to modern instrumentation.The Australian hip hop group Astronomy Class has recorded with Kak Channthy, a native born Cambodian female singer.The Dengue Fever rock and roll band features a Cambodian female singer and back-up band from California. It is classified as \"world music\" and combines Cambodian music with Western style rock.\n\n\n== Science and technology ==\n\nA National Committee for Science and Technology representing 11 ministries has been in place since 1999. Although seven ministries are responsible for the country's 33 public universities, the majority of these institutions come under the umbrella of the Ministry of Education, Youth and Support.In 2010, the Ministry of Education, Youth and Support approved a Policy on Research Development in the Education Sector. This move represented a first step towards a national approach to research and development across the university sector and the application of research for the purposes of national development.This policy was followed by the country's first National Science and Technology Master Plan 2014\u20132020. It was officially launched by the Ministry of Planning in December 2014, as the culmination of a two-year process supported by the Korea International Cooperation Agency. The plan makes provision for establishing a science and technology foundation to promote industrial innovation, with a particular focus on agriculture, primary industry and ICTs.\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nIndex of Cambodia-related articles\nOutline of Cambodia\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n=== Citations ===\n\n\n=== Cited sources ===\n\n\n== External links ==\n\n\"Cambodia\".

          "We took a boat trip for 1 hour to arrive the silk island. It was like going into an ancient Cambodia where we found pagodas with tradition, village life style and the old way of silk production. It was fun to investigate the life cycle of silk worm and how the silk was produced.",
          "This place is a tourist trap. DO NOT BUY ANYTHING HERE, they will rip you off big time. You can buy the same things 4 times cheaper in the market in Phnom Penh or Siem Reap. They are not real weavers, they just go through the motions and 7sell stuff from elsewhere. The whole",

          "If you like cycling hire a bike in Phnom Penh and take the ferry....makes an interesting half day. You can then cycle around the island easily. Interesting to see the silk making process. Keeping crocodiles in a confined space is cruel and unnecessary. If you want to spend",
          "Loved everything about the ferry ride and spending time on the beach with the locsls eating a drinking. I like learning at the silk farm but Im still bothered by the poor care of the animals at it. They were cages so small they could barely move. I dont think the alligator",

The ferry itself is very primitive, but interesting if you\u2019re into developing world ingenuity.",
          "Koh Dach, more commonly known as Silk Island, is an island in Phnom Penh sitting at the confluence of the Tonle River and the Mekong. Apart from agriculture, the main enterprise on the island is silk weaving, which is done at both a factory and as a cottage industry. The silk",
          "This is also called the Silk Island. One need to get a tuk-tuk to get there. You cross the Tonle Sap over a bridge and then cross the Mekong River with a ferry. The island have small villages. I think most people on the island are involved in the silk worm trade. We were taken",

          "A trip to Koh Dach Island is about 1 hour each way from PP Central, including a ferry crossing. It is possible to go by a private car, tuk tuk or a bicycle. Unlike many artisan villages, this one is still pretty much a home to self employed silk weavers. There is a tourist",
          "Cross the Tonle Sap river and took a ferry across the Mekong River. Suggest to take a bicycle (if you can bear cycling under the hot sun) or a tuk-tuk from Phnom Penh. First visit should be the village on the island. You can see their life and even stop at one of the village",
          "Everything went well until we saw the animals in super tiny cages, no water and nothing that resembles their natural habitat. Just a concrete floor and a fence. It ruined the whole experience for us. It's not a zoo so there's no reason to have the animals there. We came to see",

          "The floor is made of more than 5,000 SOLID SILVER tiles! I wonder what they would be worth??? It's also known as the Temple of the Emerald Buddha.",
          "As the Silver Palgodawas close by the Royal Palace, we decided to visit it. The highlight of our visit was the miniature version on the temple, Angkor Wat. Once again, good photos were taken of the Silver Pagoda.",
          "We visited as part of the Palace tour. Building looks more impressive outside than inside. Much is made of the silver floor, most of which is covered. Nice model of the Angkor Wat Temple in the grounds.",
          "It is a beautiful building plus the added interest of the buddha statue and other exhibits inside the Pagoda. Does not take long to visit. We visited the palace and the Pagoda in around an hour.",
          "..... in less than 1 hour Silver pagoda and life of royal family well documented. Sihanouk the older was quite a celebrity at his prime",
          "Overall I found the pagoda and the palace disappointing. You cannot see much of the silver floor inside the pagoda, although there are lots of other objects inside the pagoda. There are no descriptions here to tell you what things are so without a guide (which is an extra $10)",

          "highlight of the royal palace complex was the silver Pagoda. The buddha with its jewels and gold is amazing and it is an interesting experience to walk on a floor made of silver",
          "This attraction is only open from 8 am to 10:30 am and 2 pm to 5 pm most days and shares the grounds of the royal palace. For 10 USD it is worth seeing, but we found that in February 2020 when we went a lot of the buildings were under maintenance. Plan to spend an hour or two in",
          "For me not massively interesting, but worth a visit if you have time. Most interesting for me were the photos of the prince and world influencers like ghandi",

          "The Royal Palace and Silver Pagoda give a view into the past of Cambodia. Many beautiful buildings and historical relics. The cast iron pavillion build by the French is unique. You can see many treasures of royal regalia from the 19th and early 20th centuries.",
          "Located inside Royal Palace grounds. Nice piece of architecture. We had a hard time finding it at first because it was on the other side of the grounds. There is a miniature replica of Angkor Wat nearby. Had a vendor sell ice cream and water in the courtyard.",
          "Like all capital city palaces this is overpriced; however unlike Bangkok at least you get a glimpse inside the palace throne room. The gardens are beautifully kept and a credit to those who manage them. The Silver Pagoda does contain a bejewelled Buddha and a lovely emerald",

          "Visited the Silver Pagoda while we were at the Royal palace and while at first it isn\u2019t something that special the reliefs depicting the history of the gods in Cambodia alongside the Pagoda and the large Emerald Buddha (its actually made of Jade) are well worth a visit when you",
          "The Silver Pagoda within the Royal Palace compound is very impressive. From the 5,000 silver tiles on the floor to the Emerald Buddha and the Diamond-studded, golden Buddha, this temple hall is fascinating and not-to-be-missed while in Phnom Penh.",

          "The Silver Pagoda is a must to visit. The whole ground is amazing and the colours of the surrounding buildings all compliment the surroundings. The staff in the grounds are very helpful. My advice would be to visit either early morning or late evening as it can get very hot.",
          "The only thing Silver is the flooring of this Pagoda. All the statues inside are made of gold and diamonds.",
          "Just a few dollars for ticket, and you get to take some decent photos with golden temple / place in the background, nice. I cant see if there is any other places to go thats more worth while in the city.",

          "On entering the silver pagoda I was expecting silver ... the silver apparently refers to some tiles on the floor mostly covered by rugs. The Buddha\u2019s were beautiful but all the beautiful items in the cabinets badly needed cleaning. They were full of dust. It\u2019s a stunning",
          "Pagoda built in 1962 after a wood building. Floor of the Pagoda with silver layers, Golden Buddha with over 9000 smaragds and paintings of Buddha's live. Very important to visit - the 400 m paintings of the wall arround the Pagoda and the stupas in this area",
          "If they referred to this pagoda by its traditional name of the Temple of the Emerald Buddha I wouldn\u2019t have a problem as you are allowed to enter this one and you do get up close to the Emerald Buddha, a Baccarat-crystal sculpture sitting on a gilded pedestal, as well as several",
          "The silver pagoda was very beautiful, with impressive silver tiles (most are covered to prevent damage.)",
          "Many silver tiles but you cannot see many as the floor is covered in carpets to protect them. Many Buddhas of all sizes.",
          "So amazingly kept. Beautiful to see all of the jewels and gems. The silver floor is amazing. All part of the royal palace fee. Well worth a visit",
          "Silver pagoda was in the Royal Palace. That was very great to visit and step on 5000 floor tiles was made by silver. I cant imaging if my house lay the silver floor tiles. Nice to visit to had great memory.",
          "Silver Pagoda is located in the same premises of Royal Palace. The entrance fee was 40000 KHR (10 USD) when I have visited in January, 2019. The entrance fee is bit on the higher side though one may need some 2 to 3 hours to cover whole premises. The premises cover several",
          "Had a half day visiting Phnom Penh city and visit the Pagoda. It's beautiful, easy to find and access by tuk tuk.",
          "There's a lot to look at and it is best to have a tour so you can ask questions. The grounds are very open so bring water and a hat ot umbrella. There is free water at the exit. Wear shoes easy to take off as you can't wear them inside thw temple.",
          "A supreme example of the artisanship and craftsmanship both inside and out. There is an example of the solid silver floor by the entrance, the rest is covered.",
          "This is within the Royal Palace grounds. It's very beautiful. It's one of the few structures you can walk inside and take photos.",

          "Being so named as it\u2019s entire floor is tiled with solid silver blocks, over 5,000.... One has to take off ones shoes before entering, even though the vast majority of the silver blocks are covered with carpets... Housed also inside the pagoda are many cabinets filled with a huge",
          "Our guide got us here early before it got really busy. He explained well a lot of the artifacts on show. So many to see. The floor is amazing even though just a small part is now visible Take your shoes off before entering and hats too Highly recommend",
          "I covered my shoulders, elbows and knees in preparation for entering the palace. If you are not properly covered you will be required to purchase a shirt to use during your touring of the palace grounds. There are two opening times for the palace, I entered at the 2:00pm opening",
          "We loved the tour we had here. Had our own private tour guide and driver organised in NZ before we left.",
          "This is a must on the itinerary. Beautiful structure with lots of history. Was one of our first stops in Phnom Penh great introduction to Cambodia",
          "This is a beautiful building - including the fabled silver floor. There are the requisite mats and carpets to protect the tiles - shame that they didn\u2019t use a suspended glass floor - but an amazing experience just the same - as is the whole Royal Palace complex. Allow 1-2 hours",

Break time from 1200 to 1400. Highly recommend coming at 1400.",

          "A silver floor and many gold and gems to see here. It was beautiful inside! absolutely loved it. There are many things to see",

          "The Silver Pagoda is a lovely building with an amazing history. Positioned near the Royal Palace you can do both together. Lots of artefacts to see - in fact an extraordinary amount, so there is lots of see. You don't need to look at every thing but you can find some wonderful",
          "This palace is obviously very beautiful with magnificent gardens . It\u2019s best to go early to avoid crowds and the heat . Sadly many of the beautiful Buddha\u2019s and clothing and jewelry is not well displayed and squashed into a tiny room in certain places . You dont really need a",
          "One of the highlights of Phnom Penh. The gardens and buildings surrounding the palace were amazing, very similar to the Grand Palace in Bangkok, just on a smaller scale. The Silver Pagoda was not in as good a condition as the Palace but is in the process of being renovated after",
          "The tour of the Royal Palace was for me pretty far down the list of things I really wanted to see, yet it would have been a shame to miss it and its centerpiece, the Silver Pagoda. The place is not well marked with signs, so it's just a leisurely wandering around and admiring",
          "Beware that you cannot take pictures inside. One of the most beautiful pagodas in Phnom Penh and even Cambodia.",
          "The Silver Pagoda is within the Palace complex. The grounds and buildings are well maintained. Nothing really spectacular to see, maybe it\u2019s worth noting the Jade and Gold Buddha. But you are not allowed to take photos. Honestly, if I were you I wouldn\u2019t waste 40,000Riel to see",

          "The Silver pagoda is in the compound of the Royal Palace. Also includes the Emerald Buddha and home of the King and other members of the royal family. If the blue flag is flying then you know the king is in residence. Very opulent. We spent no more than an hour walking around",

          "Beautiful temple located at the Royal Palace of Phnom Penh. The floor of the temple used to be covered in silver panels and the walls used to be made of grey marble - that\u2019s why it called silver pagoda. The temple is the house of Emerald Buddha - green glass statue of Buddha",
          "The silver pagoda is a nice temple in the Royal Palace. It looks big and beautiful from the outside. However from the inside it was crowded and there wasn't much to see, only lots of little gold and silver statues. Taking pictures isn't allowed but the guards are far too caught",

          "We are never happy if we are not allowed to make photos but to visit the Silver Pagoda was for me the absolute highlight in Phnom Penh. A fantastic building with a floor of siver in a very impressing temple complex - for me more impressive than the temple of the smaragd buddha",

          "This small,imposing structure houses a grand temple of Lord Buddha. Inside, one can see numerous idols of Lord Buddha. The most impressive idol was the life sized golden statue of Buddha,encrusted with diamonds. But the temple is more known for the small Emerald statue of",

          "The pagoda is made up of about 5000 silver tiles and has a lovely green Buddha. Whether it is jade or emerald, well its anybody's guess. The pagoda has a large future Buddha with diamonds ranging from 25 carats to 15 carats all over the Buddha with the largest 25 carats being on",

          "Located in the Royal Palace Complex, the Silver Pagoda is named as such because of the silver floor tiles. Unfortunately, in order to maintain these tiles, they have covered much of the area with carpet so the place just looks like a large Buddhist temple. Annoyingly, no",

          "The grounds are neatly kept, but relative to the Preah Ko temple in Bangkok, this is much much smaller and have fewer buildings to look at. Good for 30 mins - 1 hr visit. A bit expensive for foreigners at $6 to enter, but cheap for locals at $0.50.",
          "It was one of the Royal Palace monument and it is forbidden for photo taking due to sacred place of pilgrimage.",

          "I've read online that there are separate prices for the pagoda and the royal palace but when we arrived, we only pay for the palace and it include the pagoda as well. The complex is beautiful. I gotta agree with some reviewers that the artifacts is rather unclean and not well",
          "We visited the whole Royal Palace complex when we visited Phnom Penh and it was an amazing experience! Totally worth it!",

          "Loved it all. Such a special insight into culture and rituals for the Cambodians. Amazing wealth from a developing country where there is so much poverty poured into their Buddha statues. Silver floor fascinating but again lavish worship.",
          "Dont go by literal name of it, its silver Pagoda because of the tiles inside, which are pure silver and lots of other artifacts this pagoda olds within. Beautiful architecture and a must visit",

          "The Silver Pagoda in the Khmer Royal Palace is one the recommended place by most of the Cambodian. Should not miss when you're in Phnom Penh. You step on real silver tiles, see golden statues and most of them of Buddha and of different arts of the Khmer.",
          "Silver floor totally covered by carpet so you don\u2019t really see it). Lalique Buda. No photos. :( Little to no info available on exhibits). :(",
          "While impressive, the pagoda can only be viewed from a distance, so it can't really be appreciated. It is part of the Royal Palace grounds, so it's also easy to miss if you don't know what you're looking for.",
          "The silver pagoda is definitely worth a visit. The floor is made of silver which is quite incredible",
          "The whole floor, which is now covered for protection, is made up of silver tiles. Quite something. Lots of Buddha statues to see.",
          "Well worth visiting. Beautiful place. Gives an impression of the Cambodia pre Pol Pot, as does the Royal Palace alongside.",
          "Friday 11th January and we visited the Royal Palace in Phnom Penh, this wonderful Pagoda is situated on the South side of the Royal Palace. The name is Wat Ubaosoth Ratanaram but is more widely known as the Temple of the Emerald Buddha, or the Silver Pagoda. The Silver Pagoda",
          "As others have said you purchase a ticket for the royal palace 10us and the silver pagoda is in the same grounds.The pagoda has a silver floor but apart from seeing a few tiles as you enter , the rest of the floor is covered up with carpet .There are many little silver buddhas",
          "The silver floor is amazing and the Buddha\u2019s are absolutely beautiful. Probably more crowded on the weekends. The large Buddha in the center is fabulous. No photos inside. Your shoulders and kneeshave to be covered.",
          "The silver pagoda was closed during our visit, so we only saw outside, but the entire complex is amazing, the murals on the walls surrounding it are some of the most interesting I've seen, really beautiful. Definitely worth a visit. Take water, as its very hot. Sadly no guide",
          "Another no photos location and tread carefully as the silver tiles in the floor are loose. Lots of buddha statues all around.",
          "The exquisite architecture, with the flourishes found on Cambodian roofs, houses an impressive collection of Buddha statues. The silver floor is etched with designs and the impressive Diamond Buddha overlooks the shrine.",
          "Nothing special here, it is located within the royal palace compound. I think the royal family member's stupas are located around it.",
          "The mural Fresco outside is much more impressive. The pagoda itself looks good from the outside but the inside is filled with stuff (basically tat) donated to the royal family over the years. As a result it looks like my parent's storage cellar or garage. The emerald Buddha at",
          "Nice gardens, but a little underwhelming overall. Probably best to get a guide to fully understand what the grounds encompass - we visited this on our first day in Cambodia without a guide, after spending 10 days with a guide we can look back on our visit here and understand",
          "Our visit here exposed us to the culture and beauty of the Cambodian people. Our guide provided a great picture of the various buildings and grounds.",
          "Silver Pagoda cannot be separated from Royal Place, and this place is better for walking. And tickets for entry to this place are paid for the Royal Place.",
          "The floor which is silver is mainly covered in carpet. And the rest is same old same old, it\u2019s a temple just like the rest",

          "There is no entrance to enter the Silver Pagoda as the $10 ticket price has already been paid for the Royal Palace ticket. I actually liked the Silver Pagoda a bit more than the Royal Palace. Be aware that you can\u2019t take any photos inside the Silver Pagoda. The grounds here are",

          "Many valuable items in this building, with a solid gold Buddha encrusted with diamonds. Very beautiful. Though I was disappointed that only a fraction of the silver floor is visible, as it is mostly covered by rugs.",
          "Well worth a visit and a chance to look at a lot of the costumes and curios of the king! Colourful and compact.",
          "The name is deceiving because it\u2019s not silver, the floor inside is. To enter you need to take off your shoes but you aren\u2019t actually walking on the silver. You walk on a carpet which you can tell is on a hard surface. You can see sections of the floor but some of these need",
          "The fascination of this pagoda is that all the floor is covered in silver tiles but.. they are all covered by carpets to preserve them. Even if it is perfectly understandable considering the amount of tourists, it is a bit of a shame as it loose part of the fascination. Yet,",
          "its a nice and unique pagoda inside the complex of the Silver Pagoda but in the other block. u got to walk like 25 mtr from the 1st block to the 2nd block to see the silver pagoda and other nice things located in the 2nd block. thr route is well marked so no way of losing",

          "Amazing collection and worth the visit. No photography allowed. But eyeglass and button cameras may work if you really need that photo. Pagoda is part of the palace entry fee.",
          "I\u2019m glad our group had a tour guide to provide the in depth commentary on this beautiful pagoda. The silver floors and other attractions within make this a great stop.",
          "Inside you can see some of the silver floor tiles which give the pagoda it's name. The Emerald Buddha is much smaller than i expected. Also on display are heaps of Buddhas given as gifts to the King/s. Outside, the stupas housing the ashes of 5 past Kings are ornate and",
          "I wrote a review on the royal palace in general as the entrance fee is for both The silver pagoda and the royal palace grounds. The reason it does not get 5 stars is the price. It\u2019s really fascinatingly beautiful, we spent at least an hour in the area around the Silver Pagoda.",

          "A pretty place packed with treasures, it's located on the grounds of the Palace and is certainly worth a visit.",

          "You can see the silver tiles in several places around the pagoda and the emerald buddha is amazing. So much history in one place.",
          "The Silver Pagoda looks very beautiful and the floor is covered in sterling silver blocks. The buddha within the pagoda looks very majestic. A must see!",
          "It\u2019s a nice monument to visit. Because there aren\u2019t much to do in phnom phen, if you have time to do the area. It is not a must just see place but it holds value to the people",

          "The Silver Pagoda is part of the Royal Palace complex and worth your time to visit. The Pagoda is named after the total of 5,329 hand made silver tiles that cover the floor. Many of the tiles are covered with rug to protect them. Few are visible. Amazing to see the tiles",

          "When leaving the Royal Palace, you go to the Silver Pagoda. We didn't have enough time to see everything. The buildings are really beautiful, and so huge. Make time to look around the museum before you leave.",
          "Once you buy a ticket and enter to Royal palace premises, you could visit Silver pagoda to since it is situated in the same place. It is a valuable place because of its floor is containing silver tiles. although most of tiles have covered with carpets, you could see few opened",

          "The Silver Pagoda, as part of the Royal Palace, is impressive. Definitely worth a visit (the full Royal Palace grounds)",
          "It's ok to visit this place if you have time to spare, but it can be missed. Not so special when you've already visited other pagodas in Asia. I didn't see any silver but maybe they call concrete silver in Cambodia :)",
          "Maybe unrealistic expectations but I assumed we would actually be able to see the \"silver pagoda\" rather than the tiles poking out from around the edges of a rug. The room is beautifully decorated but you really can't appreciate the silver as you can't see enough of it.",

          "The Main item of note in this Pagoda is that the floor is entirely made of silver. However 95% of it is covered with rugs so you don\u2019t really get the feeling of massive amounts of silver. The rest of the building is filled with Buddhas contributed by the Cambodian people.",

          "Interesting palace to visit, the only part not open are the royal residencies, Dancing Pavilion and the Pavilion of Napoleon III. Can get very crowded but even so, there were always chances to take photo's without people in them. The palace is positioned to face the rising sun,",
          "Our guide was so knowledgeable on this palace that it made the visit really interesting. The fact that the colours all mean something etc. The King was in residence while we were there, I feel a little sorry for him, having thousands of tourists walking around his front",
          "So named as Silver Pagoda because of the thousands of silver colored floor tiles, it is still amazing that these very old building is still immaculately clean and preserved. The exhibits of important mementos used by the King and Queen are fantastic!",
          "This complex of buildings and shrines, is a cultural must. Allow yourself plenty of time to explore and I would recommend getting there early to avoid the worst of the crowds and tours, and of course the heat of the day. That said you can wonder freely, there is no time",

          "The whole complex is stunning! The gardens are immaculately kept and a pleasure to walk through. Not all of the buildings are open to the public but you can still see the palace from the outside. The coronation building is not accessible but you can stand in the doorway to see",
          "This attraction is not all it is cracked up to be the items are very poorly displayed and photography is not allowed. The whole place would benefit from modern ways of displaying previous items. We as a company are not placing tours in Phnom Penh",
          "Slightly misleading title as it's not a silver 'Pagoda'. It is a Pagoda with a silver tiled floor, most of which are covered to protect them. Still quite interesting, though somewhat disappointing when expecting a whole Pagoda made of silver.",
          "The silver tiles are actually very large (maybe 5\" square) and most are covered up to protect them, which takes away the novelty of having a silver floor... It's fine, but in the end it's just another temple.",
          "When you are going to visit the silver pagoda you are automatically visiting the royal palace. Tickets are 10 dollar per person. I think it\u2019s best to take a guide (we didn\u2019t), else you don\u2019t really know where you\u2019re looking at because there are no signs. At the royal palace",
          "On the grounds of the Royal palace also lies this famous pagoda. You can watch a small sliver of silver tiles in the pagoda because the rest is covered with carpet to protect it. The surroundings are nice and there are great murals and chedi's to look at and admire.",

          "The Silver Pagoda sits within the Royal Palace complex and houses many beautiful statutes and objects. It\u2019s unfortunate that it is so crowded. I\u2019d suggest getting here early in the morning when it opens instead of mid-afternoon when we visited",

          "Certainly worth visiting. It'a a vVery special feeling, walking on silver while seeing all the artifacts.",
          "I book the tour with the hotel day in advance. Tour bus arrived at 8am at hotel. From there we proceed to Memorial Area before going to the Silver Pagoda. The entrance fee is USD10 and tour guide is USD10 for your visit. In the entrance we found the Buddha Tree and few",

          "This was the last of many pagodas I visited in Phnom Penh, and by far the least interesting. It's clearly 'sold' on its literal silver floor (barely visible) but this seems to have meant that its soul has also been sold.",
          "I know there are a lot of Pagodas to see in this part of the world but they all have a uniquness. THe Silver Pagoda is really very lovely, the statues and riches inside there are worth the time to see, such a different world to what was outside the gates,",

          "There is actually more than one Silver Pagoda within the Royal Palace... and they are actually stupas (i.e. containing the relics) of former Kings and Queens of Cambodia. Each pagoda is surrounded by a perimeter fence, although you will still be able to see the beautiful",

          "There are many Bhudda statues and offerings of money and fruit were given to the statues as it was the New Year.. The floor is tiled with 5000 genuine silver tiles manufactured in France and the intricacy of the carvings etc very beautiful. Remember to remove hats and to cover",

          "A wonderfully restored palace. very recommended for a 2-3 hours visit. one has to wear appropriate clothing. some parts are not allowed for photography. throne hall is closed for visitors. one can see it from outside. I recommend to get a tourist guide to give you excellent",

          "A wonderfully restored monument, filled with treasures from the glory days of the Khmer Empire. Highly recommended for a leisurely visit, but remember to wear appropriate clothing!",
          "Took a tour with a guide which I recommend. Great for persons really interested in the culture and or the unique Khmer beliefs..",
          "I didn't pay to go inside, but the Silver Pagoda looked great from the outside. Actually, the whole grounds looked nice.",
          "The Royal Palace is a good place to visit. One of the palace buildings is the Silver Pagoda (it's the floor tiles that are silver, not the pagoda itself!). With its stunning Emerald Buddha, the Silver Pagoda is a must-see.",
          "This is one of the greatest site that tourists shouldn't be missed when entering Royal Palace. Unlike ordinary pagoda, this ancient Buddhist temple comprises of many valuable Khmer national treasures such as gold Buddha statue, priceless Emerald Buddha statue etc. A place with",
          "Whilst visiting the Royal Palace I discovered the Silver Pagoda standing so majestically amongst such an avast display of Royal settings. Although there isn't entry into the pagoda it's presence amongst the gold palace surrounds makes it uniquely special in its own way. Well",
          "Take a walk around the silver pagoda and look at some interest exhibits. Worth it if you're in Phnom Penh",
          "Located on the south side of the Royal Palce, the Silver Pagoda's official name is Wat Ubosoth Ratanaran. The Pagoda is famous with its floor lined with solid silver tiles!",
          "Worth a visit. Magnificent structure. Extensive collection of historical objects. If you are a student of history, the place will not disappoint. Visit during he cool season & spend your time looking at all the incredible objects on display.",
          "Visited this beautiful building whilst touring the adjacent Royal Palace. Known as the silver pagoda because of the thousands of silver tiles that cover the floor it also houses numerous other treasures including gold and emerald Buddhas",
          "Good to know the culture of cambodia very amazing want stay for long in cambodia. I love cmbodia and their culture they give respect when they meet together.",
          "Worth the queue and the heat to see this wonderful sight. Its a very busy place and you need lots of time to be able to wonder around.",
          "Great Visit to the Silver Pagoda. Amazing architecture! Had a wonderful time to explore. But be aware of the monkeys - they are not friendly!! :-)",
          "Spending 10$ for ticket to visit both royal palace and silver Pagoda. There are more than 5000 silver panes on the floor. Inside the pagoda have 2 Buddha statue: the emerald statue and gold standing buddha statue. Tourism place, nothing special.",
          "You couldn't see silver on this pagoda. Maybe they moved them. The ticket is 10$ together with Royal palace.",
          "Visited as part of our tour of the Royal Palace Complex, and well worth a visit on it's own. Named after the silver tiles that cover the floor, Unfortunately only a few are now visible as the vast majority of the floor is now covered due to previous damage caused by the vast",
          "You need to pay to enter but it's not too expensive and it's worth a visit. Be mindful of what your wearing especially females. Shorts should be fine but not very short ones. Make sure you wear sun screen around the grounds.",
          "The Silver Pagoda is a short walk from the main Quay. It is a very beautiful building. Will take less than 1/2 hour to see.",
          "The amount of tourists over the years have damaged the silver floor to the extent that it is now completely covered.",
          "Just stunningly beautiful. It can be very hot so have some water at hand as you want to spend time here",
          "Found this place to be very calm. You cannot take pictures inside. The floor is made of real Silver Tiles hence the name.",
          "Silver Pagoda located inside the Royal Palace area. If u expect a big silver shiny pagoda u won't get it. It was called Silver Pagoda because the tile of this place made from silver, so not the entire building. To enter this building u need to take off your shoes.",
          "This is a beautiful pagoda, located within the palace compound. Your entry ticket to the Royal Palace gives you entry to the pagoda. The silver tiles on the floor are interesting but most are covered with carpet for protection. The best part are the magnificent gold statues",
          "Silver pagoda was under renovations when I visited. It was pretty much empty. The jade Buddha\u2019s were missing. One was moved to the other pagoda and the another grew arms and legs and went elsewhere. Being told it was under renovation would\u2019ve been nice by the ticket office.",
          "Part of the Royal Palace. Silber tiled floors . Was ok though really not worth the entrance fee. Toilets were wet and dirty.",
          "Visited as part of our tour of the royal palace. The floor is made up of silver from old coins the melted down . Lots of people worshipping.",
          "The whole complex is amazing, the buildings are highly decorated with gems, gold and silver. A must see when you are in Phnom Penh",
          "With all the fuss getting in, I had expected it to be even more impressive. Lots of Buddhas etc. Not allowed to bring shoes inside and need to have shoulders covered. Good break to cool off at the fans.",
          "A very beautiful temple inside the Royal Palace.It was one of the finest we visited during our trip. Not to be missed.",
          "The silver Pagoda was beautiful and the colors were dazzling. This is a great example of Khmer (Cambodian) architecture which is unique to the country. One will do a lot of walking, so wear good walking shoes.",
          "After buying entry tickets we paid another $5 for an English speaking guide for the tour. Sonita was informative and very helpful and showed us all access to the Silver Pogoda.",
          "This pagoda was so named because the floor is covered by about 5 tons of silver tiles! Only a very few are visible now as they have been preserved by covering them with a carpet. Apart from the beauty of the architecture there is an amazing collection of artifacts including many",
          "One of the most expensive things to do in Phnom Penh ($10 entrance fee!). I'm still not sure if it was completely worth the money but still very interesting to visit. I particularly liked the painted mural that surrounds the main courtyard - it's currently under renovation but",
          "I have never been so very close and unsupervised in front of national treasures. Everything is beautiful and the hospitality and nature of the Cambodians is so evident here as they trust everyone's good nature.",
          "We went there in the afternoon and it was very very hot. We must take off our shoes in some area. Some of the area are being restored and therefore closed to visitors. Some sections can only be seen from outside of the windows or doors and not visitors are allowed to be in",
          "You visit the silver pagoda as part of a tour of the palace. It is a beautiful building with it silver tiled floor. There are many displays of Arti facts around the main room. Worth a visit",
          "This is part of the royal palace complex. The floor is made from plates of melted down silver coins. The building is beautifully maintained and the shrine inside is ornate and colourful with so much gold.",
          "On the grounds of the royal palace is the silver pagoda. You remove shoes outside and walk through the pagoda. Statues of Buddha and artifacts associated with that historic period. The silver pagoda is a few hundred metres from the royal palace. The same admission ticket allows",
          "Like all pagodas you have to remove your shoes and socks to enter. The whole floor is made of small silver squares, and the display cabinets in the rooms are filled with uniforms, Royal clothing, clothes for the different days of the week, royal headware and varied precious",
          "It can be visited in conjunction with the royal palace, under the same ticket. Very special pagoda!!",
          "I suppose when visiting a foreign city one of the things to do is to visit places like this and royal palaces. This one was OK to a point. The architecture is very impressive but admittedly the grounds are much of a muchness. After the event if I had not been able to tour this",
          "Loved seeing this on the royal palace tour. Dress appropriately for both. Cover your knees and shoulders. Only negative is the ban on photos inside. Golden Buddha is amazing!",
          "Luckily the silver Pagoda is included in the palace grounds ticket. It\u2019s not worth the visit on its own. The price for the entrance is in Riel, and it\u2019s one of the few places that\u2019s doesn\u2019t do the 4000 riel to $1 general conversion. There are no signs for this, just the person",
          "A wonderful visit to the Silver Pagoda.The architecture is sensational and it was a very informative trip led by a knowledgable tour guide. Early morning is agood time to miss the large coach parties.",
          "This is a beautiful example of a pagoda. Worth a visit and then take in the Royal Palace at the sam etime",
          "It nice place to see, and to know what Cambodia respect for their monk and their culture , good to know here .",
          "Very nice place to see. They charging $10 for entrance, but most of the areas and halls are not allowing even for a snap. Better we will see from out side the compound.",
          "You're told to expect like 5.000 silver tiles, and when you get inside, the tiles are floor tiles that are almost completely covered by carpets! No photos inside, but the buddhas are pretty.",
          "When we visited the Royal Palace we also saw the Silver Pagoda and had a guide that we met when we entered to buy tickets, which I think was an extra $10 or so for 45 min tour. Overall it is similar building and architecture to the rest of the Palace and surrounding buildings.",
          "Lovely pagoda..full of rich's..very ornate and pretty.. A must whilst in Phnom Penh \ud83d\ude0e..takevtime to stroll..wear socks as u have to take us shoes off\ud83e\udd23",
          "The whole palace is impressive and the Silver Pagoda is the highlight. It's also one of the few buildings one can actually enter. It is also very crowded with many large tour groups ignoring the request to be quiet and lacking manners by pushing and shoving. .Worth a look but",
          "Lovely place. Very beautiful but no photography allowed. The whole complex was impressive and beautifully kept.",
          "Silver Pagoda is very pretty inside and out. You can\u2019t miss it once you\u2019re inside the palace. These structures aren\u2019t what you see in western countries so make sure you make the most of it.",
          "The name \"Silver\" Pagoda is a little misleading. The name comes from the silver floor of the pagoda, and not the building itself. Worse yet, most of the silver floor is covered up. This means that the detail to which this attraction is named, is also very well hidden. There are",
          "Worth a visit if at the Palace. You need to have your shoulders and knees covered. Shoes also need to be removed.",
          "The Pagoda has many religious art works that showcase the great artistry and history. The collection is one of the best ones in Phnom Penh",
          "My wife and I recently had the opportunity to visit the Silver Pagoda and the rest of the Royal Palace grounds. Gorgeous buildings, Buddhas, and fantastic artifacts that go many hundreds of years back in Cambodian history. Well worth a visit!",
          "We spent a while sat here just watching people pray. The place is very beautiful on the outside and even more so on the inside. We also saw some dancing and singing. A moving place and very interesting to see.",
          "A 90kg [198.4lbs] solid gold Buddha with over 2,000 diamonds [largest is 25 carats] is stunning. There is also the Emerald, Bronze and Silver Buddha.The floor is covered in silver weighing 5 tons (small part exposed for viewing at entrance). Just great art works throughout the",
          "Thank goodness it was preserved despite the 1970s. A piece of the true Khmer culture and beauty. Linger and look slowly - such detail. Keep an eye out for the sanskrit carved plaque on one of the stupa and spend time viewing the murals that are only partly restored.",
          "This is located beside royal palace. Long queue to get the tickets to enter compound. Nice architecture of buildings.. some of them are still under reconstruction..",
          "This is a must see. You can certainly take your time waundering around and our guide was great at pointing out the key features, this being one of the coolest!",
          "Note that it is closed between 11 am and 2 pm. Beautiful pagoda. You will get to it as you follow the route through the Royal Palace area. Allow a couple of hours inside the area. You can buy drinks at the end of the route.",
          "The silver pagoda is located inside the palace grounds , really wouldn\u2019t rush to go see it , ok if you have spare time in phnom phen",
          "The floor inside is covered by red carpets, probably to protect it but that means you can only see a few tiles which aren't in good shape anymore. The artifacts cant be cleaned so they're quite dusty and some are even fallen over or deteriorating, not in the state they ought to",
          "You are not allowed to take photos inside this place which is a shame because you have to see it to believe it. The floor is mostly covered with carpet now but you can still see the silver tiles underneath in some spots, amazing. The diamonds and gold ornamentation on the",
          "It is just part of the tour following the Royal Palace. It has a good collection of ancient things covered by glass. It is worth walking outside the temple but honestly nothing seems to be really impressive to me.",
          "Wasn't really anything worthwhile. The cost is tied to the royal palace ticket and the visit of the former is a waste to which this one is added. Skip altogether",
          "Some statues and lots of glitter but nothing really amazing. Be sure to go to Angkor Wat if possible.",
          "When visiting the palace and grounds you will also visit the silver pagoda. Most of the silver tiles are all covered up by carpet so you do not get the wow factor. Never the less, quite an impressive building to see and part of you overall palace visit. A guide is likely worth",
          "Lovely buildings and grounds - an amazing fresco - partly restored, very interesting. The displays weren't the best we've seen. We didn't have a guide, if you want some detail you should get one.",
          "The whole royal pavilion is interesting, get a guide to take you around to understand the history. Great photos to be had! Be prepared to take off your shoes at every pagoda/pavilion! You must be modestly dressed! Cover your knees and shoulders both men and woman!",
          "It\u2019s in the same compound with the Royal Palace so if you are visiting the Royal Palace, you should explore all the way to the Silver Pagoda. Taking a picture inside the Pagoda is prohibited and inside there are so many mesmerised statues!!",
          "This and the royal palace are together so can see both same time. They are beautiful buildings and worth to see.",
          "The Silver Pagoda, so called because of its silver covered floor. It is beautiful, as are all the areas within the Palace complex, just unfortunate that no photos are allowed.",
          "This pagoda is within the Royal palace, so we need to take an entrance ticket for the Royal palace to see the silver pagoda. This is buddist temple, which was rebuilt by the queen later on. Ofcourse its a must place to visit once you are within the Royal palace.",
          "must remove shoes. no photos allowed insdie. many other buddhas beside the beautiful emerald buddha.",
          "Beautiful temple, the pagoda's paintings are quite different than the ones you usually find in the country which makes it quite interesting as well.",
          "The \"Silver Pagoda\" is a wonderful place to visit. The grounds are lovely and the structures are amazing.",
          "A must, part of the royal palace complex. Very impressive and it is part of the royal place complex. One of the most famous architectural icons of Phnom Penh.",
          "The Silver Pagoda is part of the Royal Palace complex and so you get two for the price of one, make sure you get a guide otherwise you won't understand what it's all about. Also go in the morning before it gets too hot, they kick you out at 11 for lunch - you need about 90 mins",
          "Slightly underwhelming, given its name. Expected the Silver Pagoda to stand out. The tiles are silver, screwed onto the floor, but is largely covered with a carpet so one must look for them at the corners of the building. That\u2019s a shame. Perhaps the reason for us being a bit",
          "Does a lot of good based upon what we saw & heard, this is a living temple and it was good to see that money is spent on charitable causes rather then carpets, etc. We had a good guide to explain it to us & had an interesting half an hour here",
          "The floor is hidden and protected by carpet. It\u2019s a magnificent building though. You catch glimpses of the silver tiles",
          "The silver pagoda owes it's name to the floor, made of silver plates. There is the emerald Buddha and many other Buddha statues ornamented with gold and very many diamonds. It reminds one of the Grand Palace in Bangkok. The building is part of the Royal Palace complex and as",
          "Another part of our tour of the Royal Palace see the real silver loors, but not to be trod upon, best visited before the day gets too hot.",
          "Our guide could narrate many interesting facts about the Silver Pagoda which we saw on an idyllic, sunny day during our recent trip top Phnom Penh and the Royal Palace. I spent at last half an hour photographing the Pagoda from every conceivable angle. A magical time!",
          "Also called the 'Pagoda of the Emerald Buddha\" after a statue inside along with a significant solid gold standing Buddha which is Jewel encrusted. The building is more like a museum with so many Buddha's and other things but is supposed to be used by the current King. The silver",
          "We had a great tour guide, awesome accent. beautiful place, worth a visit. Had a good time. Lovely as always to learn about Cambodia's history.",
          "The Silver Pagoda is part of the Grand Palace complex in Phnom Penh. Beautiful craftmanship. A 'must visit'.",
          "Silver relates to the real silver floor but you only see a small sample of the floor. The Buddha is also not really emerald but stone. However it\u2019s still beautiful historic and a special place to visit.",
          "Though its called as Silver Pagoda, the Pagoda is not made from silver but the tiles inside. Can spend some time to understand the history and go through lot of antiques.",
          "The Pagoda isn't silver but the floor is! Its covered with carpet but there are areas where you can see the silver tiles. Worth wandering around just to see that.",
          "As a tourist attraction you have to visit! for me it was worth it, great building structures, so much history about the place, I did not have a tour guide, but you could hire one if you wanted, google was my history lesson, just a beautiful place to come and visit, entry fee is",
          "We walked by but didn't when in. From outside you can make pictures aswell and enjoy how much cool the buildings in PP are.",
          "I actually thought that this was all made if silver - silly me! It is the floor that is made of silver which is quite incredible. Some beautiful artefacts and statues inside, so take off your shoes and take your time to really enjoy what is on offer. You can spend hours in",
          "Worth to see. A good Collection of buddas, for those interested in these Things. Impressive building, beautiful and lots of wonderful workmanship.",
          "You\u2019re sober pagoda was very interesting and actual silver floor 91 kg of gold yet you get to take your shoes if you\u2019re already at the palace just stop in",
          "The pagoda lies at the same complex as the royal palace. The tickets allows entrance to both sites. The roofs are golden and the gardens are peaceful. Ornamentation is beautiful and symbolic. The combination of garudas and nagas indicates that this is place of peace. The floor",
          "This is located in the Royal Palace. It has a unique collection of sliver and ivory Buddhas from different regions. The overall ambiance is serene",
          "This attraction was part of the Royal Palace tour although the building is alongside and separate from the palace. Quite opulent and worth seeing as there is a gold female Buddha statue studded with diamonds as well. Biggest diamond was 25 carats! The silver tiles on the floor",
          "The external design is intricate and beautiful to admire. Once you take off your shoes and enter the pagoda you will notice the wealth housed inside with gold and silver monuments, some encrusted in jewels. The silver tiles are visible towards the rear of the pagoda while mostly",
          "they charge over 10 usd to not see a thing...what a rip off...terrible and do the tour within 30 minutes",
          "Do not miss it. You will enter through the Royal Palace. If you see too many tourist in the Royal palace begin with the pagoda. All the mural painting around the pagoda are well preserved. Inside the pagoda the must is the silver tile floor- cover with carpet but you can still",
          "After the Royal Palace this was a bit of a relief - as you could enter most of the buildings. The main temple itself is actually more like a museum being stuffed with all sort stuff of Buddhas, religious artefacts and assorted antiquities. The emerald Buddha was nice as was the",
          "When you visit the Royal Palace you get the oppotunity to see the Silver Pagode. It is very special and unique but I was quite surprised that the silver floor had remainings of tape keeping it all together.",
          "Such a wonderful place. We visited here with a guide who took us all around Phnom Penh. The Silver Pagoda was absolutely beautiful! The architecture and buildings are definitely worth checking out. Thank you and we so enjoyed his place.",
          "Come and see the treasures of Buddha. It's too bad that the floor is covered with carpet because it's completely made out of silver. A lot of statues and historic artifacts found in this place. There is a dress code you must be dressed modestly shorts past the knees and",
          "Very good . Impressive and all Buddha statues are Impressive .Quiet place . Important women must be properly dressed for palace and Pagoda ( long trousers).",
          "Good too see. The awe of gold and silver inside the building. Be respectful of the culture when you visit",
          "If one is in Phnom Penh then it is worth taking some time to visit the Silver Pagoda which is in the same complex as the palace. When inside it is worth spending time noting the several artefacts and different pieces of jewellery on display in addition to the Buddhas. The main",
          "I thought the name would refer to the roof, but its actually a silver floor and filled with silver objects. Located within the Royal Palace complex its covered by the same entrance fee",
          "The pagoda is located next to the royal palace . Basically on the same grounds. Beautiful . Smaller than I had expected. Beautiful golden Buddha statue in the Centre. other little historical artifacts are kept here too .",
          "Very beautiful displaying many different colours. There weren\u2019t to many people there during our visit which was nice, however there were pigeons everywhere.",
          "As a family of five (kids aged 11,11,9) we were not sure about going but we are happy we did. Cost is a little pricey with only kids under 6 free everyone else is $10.25USD. We were approached at the entrance by a guide and originally decided not to get one, but we are glad we",
          "Although it is covered with rugs, you can see it clearly between the edges of the carpets. The large solid gold Buddha with the diamonds is pretty impressive.unfortunately, pictures are not allowed",
          "It was a great experience. Visiting Silver Pagoda is included in the ticket to the Royal Palace. USD $10.25 as at Dec 2017.",
          "This is an amazing building which housed a gold Buddha encrusted with diamonds, and an emerald statue, 2 of the more significant statues in this building. The name Silver Pagoda derived from the silver tiles that covered the floors but this may not not be obvious as these tiles",
          "Like most tourists, i was told, i thought the Buddha was made of silver. Rather, the name comes from the thousands of silver tiles that cover the entire floor of the pagoda.",
          "An amazing Pagoda and again well worth a quick visit and photo opportunities that presents itself with this lovely building",
          "Like the Royal Palace, which it stands next to, an outwardly visually attractive building, with its fluted roofs, and its yellow and red Buddhist colouring. Inside is a little more disappointing, as it's quite dark & gloomy. You shuffle round (it's very crowded) on red carpets",
          "This is the most interesting part of the royal palace complex and if you have seen the emerald buddha in the grand palace in Bangkok then you know what to expect - you cannot take photos in this pagoda. We came with a guide and it is worth hiring one for the stories and insight",
          "Amazing Pagoda but its not really silver as pointed out by my wife as we continued to walk around looking for something silver looking. Still the Pagoda is simply stunning and a must see, but its white and gold",
          "Beautiful building both inside and out. The artifacts inside are so very interesting and the Buddah is absolutely beautiful. The floor is silver throughout, but covered with carpet to protect it.",
          "The silver Pagoda is called such because of the hundreds of silver tiles on the floor which unfortunately you can hardly see because they appear to be coming up so the majority are covered in rugs. However, the complex of temples is a lovely sight and definitely worth seeing.",
          "A very interesting part of Cambodian history and well worth a visit. I would rate this a must see when in Phnom Penh.",
          "The silver pagoda was nice and we enjoyed it but to be honest it does not reflect the real buddas of Cambodia. Lots of rich people walking around and fancy cars and thins there. For me it looks like these people here have been given money from government to build this and there",
          "Try to avoid peak times to avoid people like ourselves, tourists! Very evocative of a different era.",
          "Jade Buddah and silver floors are highlights here. Khmer Rouge did some damage to the antiquities, still it's a beautiful temple and part of your palace tour a must see for this city.",
          "Of course, if you are here to see the Royal Palace with its many mausoleums, then of course, why would you skip this one, but it really isn\u2019t impressive. The golden Buddha with its diamonds and glory is behind a murky glass that hasn\u2019t been cleaned in a while and is far less",
          "The riches inside are jaw dropping. While you stand there looking at all the gold and jewels, don't forget to remind yourself you are also standing on a solid silver floor.",
          "we get there late, i thing around 15:00, it was closed, the visitors were going out only, i tried to beg the security to let us in but unfortunately he refused. it looks very nice from outside.",
          "I couldn\u2019t believe the lavishness of the Silver Pagoda. When our guide pointed out that the floor was silver, I was blown away. The relics and history of Phnom Penh were on display and we were able to see everything in the pagoda. I thought it was a better experience than the",
          "Silver Pagoda is actually inside the Royal Palace. Walk around, take lots of photos, beautiful architecture, easy access pretty much everywhere. it could use some cleaning and restoration in some parts.",
          "The Silver Pagoda is definitely a must on a trip to Phnom Penh. The buildings are beautiful although there are areas where there is no access. The gardens are lovely and it's a nice break from the chaos of the main streets to visit here.",
          "The Silver Pagoda is located on the south side of the Royal Palace in Phnom Penh.The pagoda is floored with over 5000 silver tiles each weighing 1 kilo.It is famous for its 90 kg solid gold Buddha and an emerald Buddha The Silver Pagoda is open daily from 8 a.m. to 11 a.m. and",
          "I was confused when reading about the royal palace and silver pagoda on trip advisor, as it makes it sound like they are two separate things to visit. We got to the royal palace and got a guide for $5 per person (recommended) and she told us she was taking us to the silver",
          "This is the best place to visit in Phnom Phen. Do take a guide. It cost only 10 USD. Teh rates are fixed and you can get a recipt at the counter as well",
          "Impressive building from the outside but the name may be a bit confusing as the silver flooring is covered up with rugs. You can see a tiny bit in the corners of the main room. The tiny green Buddha has a necklace of diamonds on which is worth a visit. The feel of the place",
          "Definitely worth visiting although the crowds were a little too much. The floor is now covered in carpet to try save it from the tourist masses ruining it. Get a tour guide",
          "The Silver Pagoda, inside Royal Palace is a must to see with lot of wonderful treasures. Your knees and shoulders must be covered. Nice emerald Buddha.",
          "This place stores beautiful gold, silver and jewelled items gifted to the king. There's a 90 kg idol of Buddha which has a 25 karat diamond on the crown. Also one cannot miss the emerald statue of Buddha which glistened in the sunlight. No photography allowed inside.",
          "Named the Silver Pagoda by a British writer due to the silver tiles on the floor. The locals know it as the Emerald Pagoda as there is such a statue to Buddha here.",
          "You will see this when you go to the Royal Palace! The floors are made of silver and you can actually see them on the edges around the rug.",

          "Same entrance as the Royal Palace. You pay 10.25$ per person and what you get is disappointing. From the outside, the Pagoda looks nice. Inside you will only see some silver tiles which are fixated with some ugly tape. The rest of the floor is covered by a very old carpet.",
          "If you want to the see the Silver Pagoda you may be forgiven for almost missing it or not being able to find it because it\u2019s part of the internal structure of the Royal Palace in Phnom Penh. The building is not silver as the title might suggest and when you get inside you will",

          "Went to this temple on a very hot day, when you take your shoes off to go inside the tiles are very hot. I expected the silver tiles would be polished but they are very dull so you don't get the effect. The temple and grounds were nice to take photos.",

          "Dont be taken in by the title 'Silver Pagoda' as there isnt anything silver about it! This pagoda is in the middle of the Royal Palace grounds and looks like any other pagoda except it has a jade buddha inside. You really need a guide to explain things better, we wandered",
          "This pagoda is inside the Royal Palace area, so it is included in the visit. It is actually nice, the emerald Buddha is beautiful. Also, there are a lot of exhibit objects inside (in a totally disorganized way). I guess taking a guide for the visit is good if you really want to",

          "TWO IMPORTANT POINTS: 1) This is inside another attraction - the Royal Palace - despite Trip Advisor having this as a separate attraction, so you are not going someplace else. 2) You might see this called both the Temple of the Emerald Buddha and the Silver Pagoda. It is a",

        "wiki": "Pol Pot (born Saloth S\u00e2r; 19 May 1925 \u2013 15 April 1998) was a Cambodian revolutionary and politician who governed Cambodia as the Prime Minister of Democratic Kampuchea between 1975 and 1979. Ideologically a Marxist\u2013Leninist and a Khmer nationalist, he was a leading member of Cambodia's communist movement, the Khmer Rouge, from 1963 until 1997 and served as the General Secretary of the Communist Party of Kampuchea from 1963 to 1981. Under his administration, Cambodia was converted into a one-party communist state governed according to Pol Pot's interpretation of Marxism\u2013Leninism.\nBorn to a prosperous farmer in Prek Sbauv, French Cambodia, Pol Pot was educated at some of Cambodia's elite schools. While in Paris during the 1940s, he joined the French Communist Party. Returning to Cambodia in 1953, he involved himself in the Marxist\u2013Leninist Khmer Vi\u1ec7t Minh organisation and its guerrilla war against King Norodom Sihanouk's newly independent government. Following the Khmer Vi\u1ec7t Minh's 1954 retreat into Marxist\u2013Leninist controlled North Vietnam, Pol Pot returned to Phnom Penh, working as a teacher while remaining a central member of Cambodia's Marxist\u2013Leninist movement. In 1959, he helped formalise the movement into the Kampuchean Labour Party, which was later renamed the Communist Party of Kampuchea (CPK). To avoid state repression, in 1962 he relocated to a jungle encampment and in 1963 became the CPK's leader. In 1968, he relaunched the war against Sihanouk's government. After Lon Nol deposed Sihanouk in a 1970 coup, Pol Pot's forces sided with the deposed leader against Lon Nol's government, which was bolstered by the United States military. Aided by the Vi\u1ec7t C\u1ed9ng militia and North Vietnamese troops, Pol Pot's Khmer Rouge forces advanced and controlled all of Cambodia by 1975.\nPol Pot transformed Cambodia into a one-party state called Democratic Kampuchea. Seeking to create an agrarian socialist society that he believed would evolve into a communist society, Pol Pot's government forcibly relocated the urban population to the countryside to work on collective farms. Pursuing complete egalitarianism, money was abolished and all citizens made to wear the same black clothing. Those the Khmer Rouge regarded as enemies were killed. These mass killings, coupled with malnutrition and poor medical care, killed between 1.5 and 2 million people, approximately a quarter of Cambodia's population, a period later termed the Cambodian genocide. Repeated purges of the CPK generated growing discontent; by 1978 Cambodian soldiers were mounting a rebellion in the east. After several years of border clashes, the newly unified Vietnam invaded Cambodia in December 1978, toppling Pol Pot and installing a rival Marxist\u2013Leninist government in 1979. The Khmer Rouge retreated to the jungles near the Thai border, from where they continued to fight. In declining health, Pol Pot stepped back from many of his roles in the movement. In 1998 the Khmer Rouge commander Ta Mok placed Pol Pot under house arrest, shortly after which he died.\nTaking power in Cambodia at the height of Marxism\u2013Leninism's global impact, Pol Pot proved divisive among the international communist movement. Many claimed he deviated from orthodox Marxism\u2013Leninism, but China backed his government as a bulwark against Soviet influence in Southeast Asia. To his supporters, he was a champion of Cambodian sovereignty in the face of Vietnamese imperialism and stood against the Marxist revisionism of the Soviet Union. Conversely, he has been internationally denounced for his role in the Cambodian genocide, regarded as a totalitarian dictator guilty of crimes against humanity.\n\n\n== Early life ==\n\n\n=== Childhood: 1925\u20131941 ===\nPol Pot was born in the village of Prek Sbauv, outside the city of Kampong Thom. He was named Saloth S\u00e2r (Khmer: \u179f\u17b6\u17a1\u17bb\u178f \u179f pronounced [sa\u02d0.\u02c8lot s\u0251\u02d0]), the word s\u00e2r (\"white, pale\") referencing his comparatively light skin complexion. French colonial records placed his birth date on 25 May 1928, but biographer Philip Short argues he was born in March 1925.\n\nHis family was of mixed Chinese and ethnic Khmer heritage, but did not speak Chinese and lived as though they were fully Khmer. His father Loth, who later took the name Saloth Phem, was a prosperous farmer who owned nine hectares of rice land and several draft cattle. Loth's house was one of the largest in the village and at transplanting and harvest time he hired poorer neighbors to carry out much of the agricultural labour. S\u00e2r's mother, Sok Nem, was locally respected as a pious Buddhist. S\u00e2r was the eighth of nine children (two girls and seven boys), three of whom died young. They were raised as Theravada Buddhists, and on festivals travelled to the Kampong Thom monastery.Cambodia was a monarchy, but the French colonial regime, not the king, was in political control. S\u00e2r's family had connections to the Cambodian royalty: his cousin Meak was a consort of King Sisowath Monivong and later worked as a ballet teacher. When S\u00e2r was six years old, he and an older brother were sent to live with Meak in Phnom Penh; informal adoptions by wealthier relatives were then common in Cambodia. In Phnom Penh, he spent 18 months as a novice monk in the city's Vat Botum Vaddei monastery, learning Buddhist teachings and to read and write the Khmer language.In summer 1935, S\u00e2r went to live with his brother Suong and the latter's wife and child. That year he began an education at a Roman Catholic primary school, the \u00c9cole Miche, with Meak paying the tuition fees. Most of his classmates were the children of French bureaucrats and Catholic Vietnamese. He became literate in French and familiar with Christianity. S\u00e2r was not academically gifted and was held back two years, receiving his Certificat d'Etudes Primaires Compl\u00e9mentaires in 1941 at the age of 16. He had continued to visit Meak at the king's palace and it was there that he had some of his earliest sexual experiences with some of the king's concubines.\n\n\n=== Later education: 1942\u20131948 ===\nWhile S\u00e2r was at the school, the King of Cambodia died. In 1941 the French authorities appointed Norodom Sihanouk as his replacement. A new junior middle school, the Coll\u00e9ge Pream Sihanouk, was established in Kampong Cham, and S\u00e2r was selected as a boarder at the institution in 1942. This level of education afforded him a privileged position in Cambodian society. He learned to play the violin and took part in school plays. Much of his spare time was spent playing football and basketball. Several fellow pupils, among them Hu Nim and Khieu Samphan, later served in his government. During the new year vacation in 1945, S\u00e2r and several friends from his college theatre troupe went on a provincial tour in a bus to raise money for a trip to Angkor Wat. In 1947, he left the school.That year he passed exams that admitted him into the Lyc\u00e9e Sisowath, meanwhile living with Suong and his new wife. In summer 1948, he sat the brevet entry exams for the upper classes of the Lyc\u00e9e, but failed. Unlike several of his friends, he could not continue on at the school for a baccalaur\u00e9at. Instead, he enrolled in 1948 to study carpentry at the Ecole Technique in Russey Keo, in Phnom Penh's northern suburbs. This drop from an academic education to a vocational one likely came as a shock. His fellow students were generally of a lower class than those at the Lyc\u00e9e Sisowath, though they were not peasants. At the Ecole Technique he met Ieng Sary, who became a close friend and later a member of his government. In summer 1949, S\u00e2r passed his brevet and secured one of five scholarships allowing him to travel to France to study at one of its engineering schools.During the Second World War, Nazi Germany invaded France and in 1945 the Japanese ousted the French from Cambodia, with Sihanouk proclaiming his country's independence. After the war ended with Germany's and Japan's defeat, France reasserted its control over Cambodia in 1946, but allowed for the creation of a new constitution and the establishment of various political parties. The most successful of these was the Democratic Party, which won the 1946 general election. According to Chandler, S\u00e2r and Sary worked for the party during its successful election campaign; conversely, Short maintains that S\u00e2r had no contact with the party. Sihanouk opposed the party's left-leaning reforms and in 1948 dissolved the National Assembly, instead ruling by decree. Operatives of Ho Chi Minh's better established Vietnamese Marxist\u2013Leninist group, the Vi\u1ec7t Minh, also established a nascent Marxist\u2013Leninist movement, but it was beset by ethnic tensions between the Khmer and Vietnamese. News of the group was censored from the press and it is unlikely S\u00e2r was aware of it.\n\n\n=== Paris: 1949\u20131953 ===\n\nAccess to further education abroad made S\u00e2r part of a tiny elite in Cambodia. He and the 21 other selected students sailed from Saigon aboard the SS Jama\u00efque, stopping at Singapore, Colombo, and Djibouti en route to Marseille. In January 1950, S\u00e2r enrolled at the \u00c9cole fran\u00e7aise de radio\u00e9lectricit\u00e9 to study radio electronics. He took a room in the Cit\u00e9 Universitaire's Indochinese Pavilion, then lodgings on the rue Amyot, and eventually a bedsit on the corner of the rue de Commerce and the rue Letelier. S\u00e2r earned good marks during his first year. He failed his first end-of-year exams but was allowed to retake them and narrowly passed, enabling him to continue his studies.S\u00e2r spent three years in Paris. In summer 1950, he was one of 18 Cambodian students who joined French counterparts in traveling to Yugoslavia, a Marxist\u2013Leninist state, to volunteer in a labour battalion building a motorway in Zagreb. He returned to Yugoslavia the following year for a camping holiday. S\u00e2r made little or no attempt to assimilate into French culture and was never completely at ease in the French language. He nevertheless became familiar with much French literature, one of his favorite authors being Jean-Jacques Rousseau. His most significant friendships in the country were with Ieng Sary, who had joined him there, Thiounn Mumm and Keng Vannsak. He was a member of Vannsak's discussion circle, whose ideologically diverse membership discussed ways to achieve Cambodian independence.In Paris, Ieng Sary and two others established the Cercle Marxiste (\"Marxist Circle\"), a Marxist\u2013Leninist organisation arranged in a clandestine cell system. The cells met to read Marxist texts and hold self-criticism sessions. S\u00e2r joined a cell that met on the rue Lacep\u00e8de; his cell comrades included Hou Yuon, Sien Ary, and Sok Knaol. He helped to duplicate the Cercle's newspaper, Reaksmei (\"The Spark\"), named after a former Russian paper. In October 1951, Yuon was elected head of the Khmer Student Association (AEK; I'Association des Estudiants Khmers), establishing close links between the organisation and the leftist Union Nationale des \u00c9tudiants de France. The Cercle Marxiste manipulated the AEK and its successor organisations for the next 19 years. Several months after the Cercle Marxiste's formation, S\u00e2r and Sary joined the French Communist Party (CFP). S\u00e2r attended party meetings, including those of its Cambodian group, and read its magazine, Les Cahiers Internationaux. The Marxist\u2013Leninist movement was then in a strong position globally; the Communist Party of China had recently come to power under Mao Zedong and the French Communist Party was one of the country's largest, attracting the votes of around 25% of the French electorate.\n\nS\u00e2r found many of Karl Marx's denser texts difficult, later saying he \"didn't really understand\" them. But he became familiar with the writings of Soviet leader Joseph Stalin, including The History of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (Bolsheviks). Stalin's approach to Marxism\u2014known as Stalinism\u2014gave S\u00e2r a sense of purpose in life. S\u00e2r also read Mao's work, especially On New Democracy, a text outlining a Marxist\u2013Leninist framework for carrying out a revolution in colonial and semi-colonial, semi-feudal societies. Alongside these texts, S\u00e2r read the anarchist Peter Kropotkin's book on the French Revolution, The Great Revolution. From Kropotkin he took the idea that an alliance between intellectuals and the peasantry was necessary for revolution; that a revolution had to be carried out without compromise to its conclusion to succeed; and that egalitarianism was the basis of a communist society.In Cambodia, growing internal strife resulted in King Sihanouk dismissing the government and declaring himself prime minister. In response, S\u00e2r wrote an article, \"Monarchy or Democracy?\", published in the student magazine Khmer Nisut under the pseudonym \"Khmer daom\" (\"Original Khmer\"). In it, he referred positively to Buddhism, portraying Buddhist monks as an anti-monarchist force on the side of the peasantry. At a meeting, the Cercle decided to send someone to Cambodia to assess the situation and determine which rebel group they should support; S\u00e2r volunteered for the role. His decision to leave may also have been because he had failed his second-year exams two years in a row and thus lost his scholarship. In December, he boarded the SS Jama\u00efque, returning to Cambodia without a degree.\n\n\n== Revolutionary and political activism ==\n\n\n=== Return to Cambodia: 1953\u20131954 ===\n\nS\u00e2r arrived in Saigon on 13 January 1953, the same day on which Sihanouk disbanded the Democratic-controlled National Assembly, began ruling by decree, and imprisoned Democratic members of parliament without trial. Amid the broader First Indochina War in neighboring French Indochina, Cambodia was in a civil war, with civilian massacres and other atrocities carried out by all sides. S\u00e2r spent several months at the headquarters of Prince Norodom Chantaraingsey\u2014the leader of one faction\u2014in Trapeng Kroloeung, before moving to Phnom Penh, where he met with fellow Cercle member Ping Say to discuss the situation. S\u00e2r regarded the Khmer Vi\u1ec7t Minh, a mixed Vietnamese and Cambodian guerrilla subgroup of the North Vietnam-based Vi\u1ec7t Minh, as the most promising resistance group. He believed the Khmer Vi\u1ec7t Minh's relationship to the Vi\u1ec7t Minh and thus the international Marxist\u2013Leninist movement made it the best group for the Cercle Marxiste to support. The Cercle members in Paris took his recommendation.In August 1953, S\u00e2r and Rath Samoeun travelled to Krabao, the headquarters of the Vi\u1ec7t Minh Eastern Zone. Over the following nine months, around 12 other Cercle members joined them there. They found that the Khmer Vi\u1ec7t Minh was run and numerically dominated by Vietnamese guerrillas, with Khmer recruits largely given menial tasks; S\u00e2r was tasked with growing cassava and working in the canteen. At Krabao, he gained a rudimentary grasp of Vietnamese, and rose to become secretary and aide to Tou Samouth, the Secretary of the Khmer Vi\u1ec7t Minh's Eastern Zone.Sihanouk desired independence from French rule, but after France refused his requests he called for public resistance to its administration in June 1953. Khmer troops deserted the French Army in large numbers and the French government relented, rather than risk a costly, protracted war to retain control. In November, Sihanouk declared Cambodia's independence. The civil conflict then intensified, with France backing Sihanouk's war against the rebels. Following the Geneva Conference held to end the First Indochina War, Sihanouk secured an agreement from the North Vietnamese that they would withdraw Khmer Vi\u1ec7t Minh forces from Cambodian territory. The last Khmer Vi\u1ec7t Minh units left Cambodia for North Vietnam in October 1954. S\u00e2r was not among them, deciding to remain in Cambodia; he trekked, via South Vietnam, to Prey Veng to reach Phnom Penh. He and other Cambodian Marxist\u2013Leninists decided to pursue their aims through electoral means.\n\n\n=== Developing the Marxist\u2013Leninist movement: 1955\u20131959 ===\nCambodia's Marxist\u2013Leninists wanted to operate clandestinely but also established a socialist party, Pracheachon, to serve as a front organization through which they could compete in the 1955 election. Although Pracheachon had strong support in some areas, most observers expected the Democratic Party to win. The Marxist\u2013Leninists engaged in entryism to influence Democratic Party policy; Vannsak had become deputy party secretary, with S\u00e2r as his assistant, perhaps helping to alter the party's platform. Sihanouk feared a Democratic Party government and in March 1955 abdicated the throne in favor of his father, Norodom Suramarit. This allowed him to legally establish a political party, the Sangkum Reastr Niyum, with which to contest the election. The September election witnessed widespread voter intimidation and electoral fraud, resulting in Sangkum winning all 91 seats. Sihanouk's establishment of a de facto one-party state extinguished hopes that the Cambodian left could take power electorally. North Vietnam's government nevertheless urged Cambodia's Marxist\u2013Leninists not to restart the armed struggle; the former was focused on undermining South Vietnam and had little desire to destabilize Sihanouk's regime given that it had\u2014conveniently for them\u2014remained internationally un-aligned rather than following the Thai and South Vietnamese governments in allying with the anti-communist United States.S\u00e2r rented a house in the Boeng Keng Kang area of Phnom Penh. Although not qualified to teach at a state school, he gained employment teaching history, geography, French literature, and morals at a private school, the Chamraon Vichea (\"Progressive Knowledge\"); his pupils, who included the later novelist Soth Polin, described him as a good teacher. He courted society belle Soeung Son Maly before entering a relationship with fellow communist revolutionary Khieu Ponnary, the sister of Sary's wife Thirith. They were married in a Buddhist ceremony in July 1956. He continued to oversee many of the Marxist\u2013Leninists' underground communications; all correspondence between the Democratic Party and the Pracheachon went through him. Sihanouk cracked down on the Marxist\u2013Leninist movement, whose membership had halved since the end of the civil war. Links with the North Vietnamese Marxist\u2013Leninists declined, something S\u00e2r later portrayed as a boon. He and other members increasingly regarded Cambodians as too deferential to their Vietnamese counterparts; to deal with this, S\u00e2r, Tou Samouth, and Nuon Chea drafted a programme and statutes for a new Marxist\u2013Leninist party that would be allied with but not subordinate to the Vietnamese. They established party cells, emphasising the recruitment of small numbers of dedicated members, and organized political seminars in safe houses.\n\n\n=== Kampuchean Labour Party: 1959\u20131962 ===\nAt a 1959 conference, the movement's leadership established the Kampuchean Labour Party, based on the Marxist\u2013Leninist model of democratic centralism. S\u00e2r, Tou Samouth and Nuon Chea were part of a four-man General Affair Committee leading the party. Its existence was to be kept secret from non-members. The Kampuchean Labour Party's conference, held clandestinely from September to October 1960 in Phnom Penh, saw Samouth become party secretary and Nuon Chea his deputy, while S\u00e2r took the third senior position and Ieng Sary the fourth.Sihanouk spoke out against the Cambodian Marxist\u2013Leninists; although he was an ally of China's Marxist\u2013Leninist government and admitted Marxism\u2013Leninism's capacity to bring swift economic development and social justice, he also warned of its totalitarian character and its suppression of personal liberty. In January 1962, Sihanouk's security services cracked down further on Cambodia's socialists, incarcerating Pracheachon's leaders and leaving the party largely moribund. In July, Samouth was arrested, tortured and killed. Nuon Chea had also stepped back from his political activities, leaving open S\u00e2r's path to become party leader.As well as facing leftist opposition, Sihanouk's government faced hostility from right-wing opposition centred on Sihanouk's former Minister of State, Sam Sary, who was backed by the United States, Thailand and South Vietnam. After the South Vietnamese supported a failed coup against Sihanouk, relations between the countries deteriorated and the United States initiated an economic blockade of Cambodia in 1956. After Sihanouk's father died in 1960, Sihanouk introduced a constitutional amendment allowing himself to become head of state for life. In February 1962, anti-government student protests turned into riots, at which Sihanouk dismissed the Sangkum government, called new elections, and produced a list of 34 left-leaning Cambodians, demanding that they meet him to establish a new administration. S\u00e2r was on the list, perhaps because of his role as a teacher, but refused to meet with Sihanouk. He and Ieng Sary left Phnom Penh for a Viet Cong encampment near Thboung Khmum in the jungle along Cambodia's border with South Vietnam. According to Chandler, \"from this point on he was a full-time revolutionary\".\n\n\n=== Plotting rebellion: 1962\u20131968 ===\nConditions at the Viet Cong camp were basic and food scarce. As Sihanouk's government cracked down on the movement in Phnom Penh, growing numbers of its members fled to join S\u00e2r at his jungle base. In February 1963, at the party's second conference, held in a central Phnom Penh apartment, S\u00e2r was elected party secretary, but soon fled into the jungle to avoid repression by Sihanouk's government. In early 1964, S\u00e2r established his own encampment, Office 100, on the South Vietnamese side of the border. The Viet Cong allowed his actions to be officially separate from its, but still wielded significant control over his camp. At a plenum of the party's Central Committee, it was agreed that they should re-emphasize their independence from the Vietnamese Marxist\u2013Leninists and endorse armed struggle against Sihanouk.The Central Committee met again in January 1965 to denounce the \"peaceful transition\" to socialism espoused by Soviet Premier Nikita Khrushchev, accusing him of being a revisionist. In contrast to Khrushchev's interpretation of Marxism\u2013Leninism, S\u00e2r and his comrades sought to develop their own, explicitly Cambodian variant of the ideology. Their interpretation moved away from the orthodox Marxist focus on the urban proletariat as the forces of a revolution to build socialism, giving that role instead to the rural peasantry, a far larger class in Cambodian society. By 1965, the party regarded Cambodia's small proletariat as full of \"enemy agents\" and systematically refused them membership. The party's main area of growth was in the rural provinces and by 1965 membership was at 2000. In April 1965, S\u00e2r travelled by foot along the Ho Chi Minh Trail to Hanoi to meet North Vietnamese government figures, among them Ho Chi Minh and L\u00ea Du\u1ea9n. The North Vietnamese were preoccupied with the ongoing Vietnam War and thus did not want S\u00e2r's forces to destabilize Sihanouk's government; the latter's anti-American stance rendered him a de facto ally. In Hanoi, S\u00e2r read through the archives of the Workers' Party of Vietnam, concluding that the Vietnamese Marxist\u2013Leninists were committed to pursuing an Indochinese Federation and that their interests were therefore incompatible with Cambodia's.\nIn November 1965, Saloth S\u00e2r flew from Hanoi to Beijing, where his official host was Deng Xiaoping, although most of his meetings were with Peng Zhen. S\u00e2r gained a sympathetic hearing from many in the governing Communist Party of China (CPC)\u2014especially Chen Boda, Zhang Chunqiao and Kang Sheng\u2014who shared his negative view of Khrushchev amid the Sino-Soviet split. CPC officials also trained him on topics like dictatorship of the proletariat, class struggles and political purge. In Beijing, S\u00e2r witnessed China's ongoing Cultural Revolution, influencing his later policies.\nS\u00e2r left Beijing in February 1966, and flew back to Hanoi before a four-month journey along the Ho Chi Minh Trail to reach the Cambodian Marxist\u2013Leninists' new base at Loc Ninh. In October 1966, he and other Cambodian party leaders made several key decisions. They renamed their organisation the Communist Party of Kampuchea (CPK), a decision initially kept secret. Sihanouk began referring to its members as the \"Khmer Rouge\" ('Red Cambodians'), but they did not adopt this term themselves. It was agreed that they would move their headquarters in Ratanakiri Province, away from the Viet Cong, and that\u2014despite the views of the North Vietnamese\u2014they would command each of the party's zone committees to prepare for the relaunch of armed struggle. North Vietnam refused to assist in this, rejecting their requests for weaponry. In November 1967, S\u00e2r travelled from Tay Ninh to base Office 102 near Kang L\u00eang. During the journey, he contracted malaria and required a respite in a Viet Cong medical base near Mount Ngork. By December, plans for armed conflict were complete, with the war to begin in the North-West Zone and then spread to other regions. As communication across Cambodia was slow, each Zone would have to operate independently much of the time.\n\n\n== Cambodian Civil War ==\n\n\n=== Against Sihanouk ===\nIn January 1968, the war was launched with an attack on the Bay Damran army post south of Battambang. Further attacks targeted police and soldiers and seized weaponry. The government responded with scorched-earth policies, aerially bombarding areas where rebels were active. The army's brutality aided the insurgents' cause; as the uprising spread, over 100,000 villagers joined them. In the summer, S\u00e2r relocated his base 30 miles north to the more mountainous Naga's Tail, to avoid encroaching government troops. At this base, called K-5, he increased his dominance over the party and had his own separate encampment, staff, and guards. No outsider was allowed to meet him without an escort. He took over from Sary as the Secretary of the North East Zone. In November 1969, S\u00e2r trekked to Hanoi to persuade the North Vietnamese government to provide direct military assistance. They refused, urging him to revert to a political struggle. In January 1970 he flew to Beijing. There, his wife began showing early signs of the chronic paranoid schizophrenia she would later be diagnosed with.\n\n\n=== Against Lon Nol ===\n\n\n==== Collaboration with Sihanouk: 1970\u20131971 ====\n\nIn March 1970, while S\u00e2r was in Beijing, Cambodian parliamentarians led by Lon Nol deposed Sihanouk when he was out of the country. Sihanouk also flew to Beijing, where the Chinese and North Vietnamese Communist Parties urged him to form an alliance with the Khmer Rouge to overthrow Lon Nol's right-wing government. Sihanouk agreed. On Zhou Enlai's advice, S\u00e2r also agreed, although his dominant role in the CPK was concealed from Sihanouk. Sihanouk then formed his own government-in-exile in Beijing and launched the National United Front of Kampuchea to rally Lon Nol's opponents.In April 1970, S\u00e2r flew to Hanoi. He stressed to L\u00ea Du\u1ea9n that while he wanted the Vietnamese to supply the Khmer Rouge with weapons, he did not want troops: the Cambodians needed to oust Lon Nol themselves. North Vietnamese armies, in collaboration with the Viet Cong, nevertheless invaded Cambodia to attack Lon Nol's forces; in turn, South Vietnam and the United States sent troops to the country to bolster his government. This pulled Cambodia into the Second Indochina War already raging across Vietnam. The U.S. dropped three times as many bombs on Cambodia during the conflict as they had on Japan during World War II. Although targeting Viet Cong and Khmer Rouge encampments, the bombing primarily affected civilians. This fuelled recruitment to the Khmer Rouge, which had an estimated 12,000 regular soldiers at the end of 1970 and four times that number by 1972.\n\nIn June 1970, S\u00e2r left Vietnam and reached his K-5 base. In July he headed south; it was at this point that he began referring to himself as \"Pol\", a name he later lengthened to \"Pol Pot\". By September, he was based at a camp on the border of Kratie and Kompong Thom, where he convened a meeting of the CPK Standing Committee. Although few senior members could attend, it issued a resolution setting out the principle of \"independence-mastery\", the idea that Cambodia must be self-reliant and fully independent of other countries. In November, Pol Pot, Ponnary, and their entourage relocated to the K-1 base at D\u00e2ngkda. His residence was set up on the northern side of the Chinit river; entry was strictly controlled. By the end of the year, Marxist forces had a presence in over half of Cambodia; the Khmer Rouge played a restricted role in this, for throughout 1971 and 1972, the majority of fighting against Lon Nol was carried out by Vietnamese or by Cambodians under Vietnamese control.In January 1971, a Central Committee meeting was held at this base, bringing together 27 delegates to discuss the war. During 1971, Pol Pot and the other senior party members focused on the construction of a regular Khmer Rouge army and administration that could take a central role when the Vietnamese withdrew. Membership of the party was made more selective, permitting only those regarded as \"poor peasants\", not those seen as \"middle peasants\" or students. In July and August, Pol Pot oversaw a month-long training course for CPK cadres in the Northern Zone headquarters. This was followed by the CPK's Third Congress, attended by around 60 delegates, where Pol Pot was confirmed as the Secretary of the Central Committee and Chairman of its Military Commission.\n\n\n=== Continuing the conflict: 1972 ===\n\nIn early 1972, Pol Pot embarked on his first tour of the Marxist-controlled areas across Cambodia. In these areas, called \"liberated zones\", corruption was stamped out, gambling was banned, and alcohol and extramarital affairs were discouraged. From 1970 to 1971, the Khmer Rouge had generally sought to cultivate good relations with the inhabitants, organising local elections and assemblies. Some people regarded as hostile to the movement were executed, although this was uncommon. Private motor transport was requisitioned.  Cooperative stores selling goods like medicines, cloth, and kerosene were formed, providing goods imported from Vietnam. Wealthier peasants had their land redistributed so that by the end of 1972, all families living in the Marxist-controlled areas possessed an equal amount of land.  The poorest strata of Cambodian society benefited from these reforms.From 1972, the Khmer Rouge began trying to refashion all of Cambodia in the image of the poor peasantry, whose rural, isolated, and self-sufficient lives were regarded as worthy of emulation. As of May 1972, the group began ordering all of those living under its control to dress like poor peasants, with black clothes, red-and-white krama scarves, and sandals made from car tyres. These restrictions were initially imposed on the Cham ethnic group before being rolled out across other communities. Pol Pot also dressed in this fashion.CPK members were expected to attend regular (sometimes daily) \"lifestyle meetings\" in which they engaged in criticism and self-criticism. These cultivated an atmosphere of perpetual vigilance and suspicion within the movement. Pol Pot and Nuon Chea led such sessions at their headquarters, although they were exempt from criticism themselves. By early 1972, relations between the Khmer Rouge and its Vietnamese Marxist allies were becoming strained and some violent clashes had broken out. That year, the North Vietnamese and Viet Cong main-force divisions began pulling out of Cambodia, primarily because they were needed for the offensive against Saigon. As it became more dominant, the CPK imposed increasing numbers of controls over Vietnamese troops active in Cambodia. In 1972, Pol Pot suggested that Sihanouk leave Beijing and tour the areas of Cambodia under CPK control. When Sihanouk did so, he met with senior CPK figures, including Pol Pot, although the latter's identity was concealed from the king.\n\n\n=== Collectivisation and the conquest of Phnom Penh: 1973\u20131975 ===\nIn May 1973, Pol Pot ordered the collectivisation of villages in the territory it controlled. This move was both ideological, in that it was seen as helping to build a socialist society free from private property, and pragmatic, in that it allowed the Khmer Rouge greater control over the food supply, ensuring that farmers did not sell their produce to government forces. Many villagers resented the collectivisation and slaughtered their livestock to prevent it from becoming collective property. Over the following six months, about 60,000 Cambodians fled from areas under Khmer Rouge control. The Khmer Rouge introduced conscription to bolster its forces. Relations between the Khmer Rouge and the North Vietnamese remained strained. After the latter temporarily reduced the flow of arms to the Khmer Rouge, in July 1973 the CPK Central Committee agreed that the North Vietnamese should be considered \"a friend with a conflict\". Pol Pot ordered the internment of many of the Khmer Rouge who had spent time in North Vietnam and were considered too sympathetic to them. Most of these were later executed.In summer 1973, the Khmer Rouge launched its first major assault on Phnom Penh, but was forced back amid heavy losses. Later that year, it began bombarding the city with artillery. In the autumn, Pol Pot travelled to a base at Chrok Sd\u00each on the eastern foothills of the Cardamon Mountains. By winter, he was back at the Chinit Riber base where he conferred with Sary and Chea. He concluded that the Khmer Rouge should start talking openly about its commitment to making Cambodia a socialist society and launch a secret campaign to oppose Sihanouk's influence. In September 1974, a Central Committee meeting was held at Meakk in Prek Kok commune. There the Khmer Rouge agreed that it would expel the populations of Cambodia's cities to rural villages. They saw this as necessary for dismantling capitalism and its associated urban vices.\n\nBy 1974, Lon Nol's government had lost a great deal of support, both domestically and internationally. In 1975, the troops defending Phnom Penh began discussing surrender, eventually doing so and allowing the Khmer Rouge to enter the city on 17 April. There, Khmer Rouge soldiers executed between 700 and 800 senior government, military, and police figures. Other senior figures escaped; Lon Nol fled into exile in the US. He left Saukham Khoy as acting president, although he too fled aboard a departing US Navy ship shortly after. Within the city, Khmer Rouge militia under the control of different Zone commanders clashed with one another, partly as a result of turf wars and partly due to the difficulty of establishing who was a group member and who was not.The Khmer Rouge had long viewed Phnom Penh's population with mistrust, particularly as the city's numbers had been swelled by peasant refugees who had fled the Khmer Rouge's advance and were seen as traitors. Shortly after taking the city, the Khmer Rouge announced that its inhabitants had to evacuate to escape a forthcoming US bombing raid; the group falsely claimed that the population would be allowed to return after three days. This evacuation entailed moving over 2.5 million people out of the city with very little preparation; between 15,000 and 20,000 of these were removed from the city's hospitals and forced to march. Checkpoints were erected along the roads out of the city where Khmer Rouge cadres searched marchers and removed many of their belongings. The march took place in the hottest month of the year and an estimated 20,000 people died along the route. For the Khmer Rouge, emptying Phnom Penh was seen as demolishing not just capitalism in Cambodia, but also Sihanouk's power base and the spy network of the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency (CIA). This helped to secure Khmer Rouge dominance over the country and was a step toward ensuring the urban population's move toward agricultural production.\n\n\n== Leader of Kampuchea ==\n\n\n=== Establishing the new government: 1975 ===\n\nOn 20 April 1975, three days after Phnom Penh fell, Pol Pot secretly arrived in the abandoned city. Along with other Khmer Rouge leaders, he based himself in the railway station, which was easy to defend. In early May, they moved their headquarters to the former Finance Ministry building. The party leadership soon held a meeting at the Silver Pagoda, where they agreed that raising agricultural production should be their government's top priority. Pol Pot declared that \"agriculture is key both to nation-building and to national defence\"; he believed that unless Cambodia could develop swiftly then it would be vulnerable to Vietnamese domination, as it had been in the past. Their goal was to reach 70 to 80% farm mechanisation in five to ten years, and a modern industrial base in fifteen to twenty years. As part of this project, Pol Pot saw it as imperative that they develop means of ensuring that the farming population worked harder than before.The Khmer Rouge wanted to establish Cambodia as a self-sufficient state. They did not reject foreign assistance altogether although regarded it as pernicious. While China supplied them with substantial food aid, this was not publicly acknowledged. Shortly after the taking of Phnom Penh, Ieng Sary travelled to Beijing, negotiating the provision of 13,300 tons of Chinese weaponry to Cambodia. At the National Congress meeting in April, the Khmer Rouge declared that it would not permit any foreign military bases on Cambodian soil, a threat to Vietnam, which still had 20,000 troops in Cambodia. To quell tensions arising from recent territorial clashes with Vietnamese soldiers over the disputed Wai Island, Pol Pot, Nuon Chea, and Ieng Sary travelled secretly to Hanoi in May, where they proposed a Friendship Treaty between the two countries. In the short term, this successfully eased tensions. After Hanoi, Pol Pot proceeded to Beijing, again in secret. There he met with Mao and then Deng. Although communication with Mao was hindered by the reliance on translators, Mao urged the younger Cambodian to not uncritically imitate the path to socialism pursued by China or any other country and to avoid repetition of more extreme acts that the Khmer Rouge had been conducting. In China, Pol Pot also received medical treatment for his malaria and gastric ailments. Pol Pot then travelled to North Korea, meeting with Kim Il Sung. In mid-July he returned to Cambodia, and spent August touring the South-Western and Eastern Zones.\n\nIn May, Pol Pot adopted the Silver Pagoda as his main residence. He then relocated to the city's tallest structure, the 1960s-built Bank Buildings, which became known as \"K1\". Several other senior government figures\u2014Nuon Chea, Sary, and Vorn Vet\u2014also lived there. Pol Pot's wife, whose schizophrenia had worsened, was sent to live in a house in Boeung Keng K\u00e2ng. Later in 1975, Pol Pot also took Ponnary's old family home in the rue Docteur Hahn as a residence, and subsequently also took a villa in the south of the city for his own. To give his government a greater appearance of legitimacy, Pol Pot organised a parliamentary election, although there was only one candidate in every constituency except in Phnom Penh. The parliament then met for only three hours.Although Pol Pot and the Khmer Rouge remained the de facto government, initially the formal government was the GRUNK coalition, although its nominal head, Penn Nouth, remained in Beijing. Throughout 1975, the Communist Party's governance of Cambodia was kept secret. At a special National Congress meeting from 25\u201327 April, the Khmer Rouge agreed to make Sihanouk the nominal head of state, a status he retained throughout 1975. Sihanouk had been dividing his time between Beijing and Pyongyang but in September was allowed to return to Cambodia. Pol Pot was aware that if left abroad, Sihanouk could become a rallying point for opposition and thus was better brought into the Khmer government itself; he also hoped to take advantage of Sihanouk's stature in the Non-Aligned Movement. Once home, Sihanouk settled into his palace and was well treated. He was allowed to travel abroad, in October addressing the UN General Assembly to promote the new Cambodian government and in November embarking on an international tour.The Khmer Rouge's military forces remained divided into differing zones and at a July military parade Pol Pot announced the formal integration of all troops into a national Revolutionary Army, to be headed by Son Sen. Although a new Cambodian currency had been printed in China during the civil war, the Khmer Rouge decided not introduce it. At the Central Committee Plenum held in Phnom Penh in September, they agreed that currency would lead to corruption and undermine their efforts to establish a socialist society. Thus, there were no wages in Democratic Kampuchea. The population were expected to do whatever the Khmer Rouge commanded of them, without pay. If they refused, they faced punishment, sometimes execution. For this reason, Short characterised Pol Pot's Cambodia as a \"slave state\", with its people effectively forced into slavery by working without pay. At the September Plenum, Pol Pot announced that all farmers were expected to meet a quota of three tons of paddy, or unmilled rice, per hectare, an increase on what was previously the average yield. There he also announced that manufacturing should focus on the production of basic agricultural machinery and light industrial goods such as bicycles.\n\n\n==== Rural reform ====\nFrom 1975 on, all those living in rural co-operatives, meaning the vast majority of Cambodia's population, were reclassified as members of one of three groups: the full-rights members, the candidates, and the depositees. The full-rights members most of whom were poor or lower-middle peasants, were entitled to full rations, and able to hold political posts in the co-operatives and join both the army and the Communist Party. Candidates could still hold low-level administrative positions. The application of this tripartite system was uneven and it was introduced to different areas at different times. On the ground, the basic societal division remained between the \"base\" people and the \"new\" people. It was never Pol Pot and the party's intention to exterminate all \"new\" people although the latter were usually treated harshly and this led some commentators to believe extermination was the government's desire. Pol Pot instead wanted to double or triple the country's population, hoping it could reach between 15 and 20 million within a decade.Within the village co-operatives, Khmer Rouge militia regularly killed those they deemed to be \"bad elements\". A common statement used by the Khmer Rouge to those they executed was that \"to keep you is no profit, to destroy you is no loss.\" Those killed were often buried by the fields, to act as fertiliser. During the first year of Khmer Rouge governance, most areas of the country were able to stave off starvation despite significant population increases caused by the evacuation of the cities. There were exceptions, such as parts of the North-West Zone and western areas of Kompong Chhnang, where starvation did occur in 1975.The new Standing Committee decreed that the population would work ten day weeks with one day off from labor; a system modelled on that used after the French Revolution. Measures were taken to indoctrinate those living in the co-operatives, with set phrases about hard work and loving Cambodia being widely employed, for instance broadcast via loudspeakers or on the radio. New neologisms were introduced and everyday vocabulary was altered to encourage a more collectivist mentality; Cambodians were encouraged to talk about themselves in the plural \"we\" rather than the singular \"I\". While working in the fields, people were typically segregated by sex. Sport was prohibited. The only reading material that the population were permitted to read was that produced by the government, most notably the newspaper Padevat (\"Revolution\"). Restrictions were placed on movement, with people permitted to travel only with the permission of the local Khmer Rouge authorities.\n\n\n=== Democratic Kampuchea: 1976\u20131979 ===\n\nIn January 1976, a cabinet meeting was held to promulgate a new constitution declaring that the country was to be renamed \"Democratic Kampuchea\". The constitution asserts state ownership of the means of production, declared equality of men and women, and the rights and obligation of all citizens to work. It outlined that the country would be governed by a three-person presidium, and at the time Pol Pot and the Khmer Rouge leaders expected that Sihanouk would take one of these roles. Sihanouk was nevertheless increasingly uncomfortable with the new government and in March he resigned his role as head of state. Pol Pot tried repeatedly, but unsuccessfully, to get him to change his mind. Sihanouk asked to be allowed to travel to China, citing the need for medical treatment, although this was denied. He was instead kept within his palace, where he was sufficiently stocked with goods to live a luxurious lifestyle throughout the Khmer Rouge years.The removal of Sihanouk ended the pretence that the Khmer Rouge government was a united front. With Sihanouk no longer part of the government, Pol Pot's government stated that the \"national revolution\" was over and that the \"socialist revolution\" could begin, allowing the country to move towards pure communism as swiftly as possible. Pol Pot described the new state as \"a precious model for humanity\" with a revolutionary spirit that outstripped that of earlier revolutionary socialist movements. In the 1970s, Marxist\u2013Leninism was at its strongest point in history, and Pol Pot presented the Cambodian example as the one which other revolutionary movements should follow.As part of the new Presidium, Pol Pot became the country's Prime Minister. It was at this point that he took on the public pseudonym of \"Pol Pot\", As no-one in the country knew who this was, a fictitious biography was presented. Pol Pot's key allies took the other two positions, with Nuon Chea as President of the Standing Committee of the National Assembly and Khieu Samph\u00e2n as the head of state. In principle, the Khmer Rouge Standing Committee made decisions on the basis of the Leninist principle of democratic centralism. In reality it was more autocratic, with Pol Pot's decisions being implemented. The parliament which had been elected the previous year never met after 1976. In September 1976, Pol Pot publicly revealed that Angkar was a Marxist\u2013Leninist organisation. In September 1977, at a rally in the Olympic Stadium, Pol Pot then revealed that Angkar was a pseudonym for the CPK. In September 1976, it was announced that Pol Pot had stepped down as Prime Minister, to be replaced by Nuon Chea, but in reality he remained in power, returning to his former position in October. This was possibly a diversionary tactic to distract the Vietnamese government while Pol Pot purged the CPK of individuals he suspected of harbouring Vietnamese sympathies.\n\nThe Cambodian population were officially known as \"Kampuchean\" rather than \"Khmer\" to avoid the ethnic specificity associated with the latter term. The Khmer language, now labelled \"Kampuchean\" by the government, was the only legally recognised language, and the Sino-Khmer minority were prohibited from speaking in the Chinese languages they commonly used. Pressure was exerted on the Cham to culturally assimilate into the larger Khmer population.Pol Pot initiated a series of major irrigation projects across the country. In the Eastern Zone, for instance, a huge dam was built. Many of these irrigation projects failed due to a lack of technical expertise on the part of the workers.Pol Pot started the \"Maha Lout Ploh\" in Cambodia, copying the \"Great Leap Forward\" of China.The Standing Committee agrees to link several villages in a single co-operative of 500 to 1000 families, with the goal of later forming commune-sized units twice that size. Communal kitchens were also introduced so that all members of a commune ate together rather than in their individual homes. Foraging or hunting for additional food was prohibited, regarded as individualistic behaviour.\nFrom the summer of 1976, the government ordered that children over the age of seven would live not with their parents but communally with Khmer Rouge instructors.\nThe co-operatives produced less food than the government believed, in part due to a lack of motivation among laborers and the diversion of the strongest workers to irrigation projects. Many party cadres also claimed that they met the government's food production quota when they had failed to do, fearing that they would be criticised for failure. The government became aware of this, and by the end of 1976 Pol Pot acknowledged food shortages in three quarters of failure.Members of the Khmer Rouge received special privileges not enjoyed by the rest of the population. Party members had better food, with cadres sometimes having access to clandestine brothels. Members of the Central Committee could go to China for medical treatment, and the highest echelons of the party had access to imported luxury products.\n\n\n==== Purges and executions ====\nThe Khmer Rouge also classified people based on their religious and ethnic backgrounds. Under the leadership of Pol Pot, the Khmer Rouge had a policy of state atheism. Buddhist monks were viewed as social parasites and designated a \"special class\". Within a year of the Khmer Rouge's victory in the civil war, the country's monks were set to manual labor in the rural co-operatives and irrigation projects. \nDespite its ideological iconoclasm, many historical monuments were left undamaged by the Khmer Rouge; for Pol Pot's government, like its predecessors, the historic state of Angkor was a key point of reference.Several isolated revolts broke out against Pol Pot's government. The Khmer Rouge Western Zone regional chief Koh Kong and his followers began launching small-scale attacks on government targets along the Thai border. There were also several village rebellions among the Cham. In February 1976, explosions in Siem Reap destroyed a munitions depot. Pol Pot suspected senior military figures were behind the bombing and, although unable to prove who was responsible, had several army officers arrested.\n\nIn September 1976, various party members were arrested and accused of conspiring with Vietnam to overthrow Pol Pot's government. Over the coming months the numbers arrested grew. The government invented claims of assassination attempts against its leading members to justify this internal crack-down within the CPK itself. These party members were accused of being spies for either the CIA, the Soviet KGB, or the Vietnamese. They were encouraged to confess to the accusations, often after torture or the threat of torture, with these confession then being read out at party meetings. As well as occurring in the area around Phnom Penh, trusted party cadres were sent into the country's zones to initiate further purges among the party membership there.The Khmer Rouge converted a disused secondary school in Phnom Penh's Tuol Sleng region into a security prison, S-21. It was placed under the responsibility of the defence minister, Son Sen. The numbers sent to S-21 grew steadily as the CPK purge proceeded. In the first half of 1976, about 400 people were sent there; in the second half of the year that number was nearer to 1000. By the spring of 1977, 1000 people were being sent there each month. Between 15,000 and 20,000 people would be killed at S-21 during the Khmer Rouge period. About a dozen of them were Westerners. Pol Pot never personally visited S-21.From late 1976 onward, and especially in the middle of 1977, the levels of violence increased across Democratic Kampuchea, particularly at the village level. Across the country, peasant cadres tortured and killed members of their communities whom they disliked. Many cadres ate the livers of their victims and tore unborn foetuses from their mothers for use as kun krak talismans. The CPK Central Command was aware of such practices but did nothing to stop them. By 1977, the growing violence, coupled with poor food, was generating disillusionment even within the Khmer Rouge's core support base. Growing numbers of Cambodians attempted to flee into Thailand and Vietnam. In the autumn of 1977, Pol Pot declared the purges at an end. According to the CPK's own figures, by August 1977 between 4000 and 5000 party members had been liquidated as \"enemy agents\" or \"bad elements\".In 1978, the government initiated a second purge, during which tens of thousands of Cambodians were accused of being Vietnamese sympathisers and killed. At this point the remaining CPK members who had spent time in Hanoi were killed, along with their children. In January 1978, Pol Pot announced to his colleagues that their slogan should be \"Purify the Party! Purify the army! Purify the cadres!\"Short says that Cambodia had become a 'slave state', in which 'Pol enslaved the people literally, by incarcerating them within a social and political structure...'\n\n\n==== Foreign relations ====\n\nOutwardly, relations between Cambodia and Vietnam were warm following the establishment of Democratic Kampuchea; after Vietnam was unified in July 1976, the Cambodian government issued a message of congratulations. Privately, relations between the two were declining. In a speech on the first anniversary of their victory in the civil war, Khieu referred to the Vietnamese as imperialists. In May 1976, a negotiation to draw up a formal border between the two countries failed.On taking power, the Khmer Rouge spurned both the Western states and the Soviet Union as sources of support. Instead, China became Cambodia's main international partner. With Vietnam increasingly siding with the Soviet Union over China, the Chinese saw Pol Pot's government as a bulwark against Vietnamese influence in Indochina. Mao pledged $1 billion in military and economic aid to Cambodia, including an immediate $20 million grant. Many thousands of Chinese military advisors and technicians were also sent to the country to assist in projects like the construction of the Kampong Chhnang military airport. The relationship between the Chinese and Cambodian governments was nevertheless marred by mutual suspicion and China had little influence on Pol Pot's domestic policies. It had greater influence on Cambodia's foreign policy, successfully pushing the country to pursue rapprochement with Thailand and open communication with the U.S. to combat Vietnamese influence in the region.After Mao died in September 1976, Pol Pot praised him and Cambodia declared an official period of mourning. In November 1976, Pol Pot travelled secretly to Beijing, seeking to retain his country's alliance with China after the Gang of Four were arrested. From Beijing, he was then taken on a tour of China, visiting sites associated with Mao and the Chinese Communist Party. The Chinese were the only country allowed to retain their old Phnom Penh embassy. All other diplomats were made to live in assigned quarters on the Boulevard Monivong. This street was barricaded off and the diplomats were not permitted to leave without escorts. Their food was brought to them and provided through the only shop that remained open in the country. Pol Pot saw the Khmer Rouge as an example that should be copied by other revolutionary movements across the world and courted Marxist leaders from Burma, Indonesia, Malaysia, and Thailand, allowing Thai Marxists to establish bases along the Cambodian border with Thailand. In November 1977, Burma's Ne Win was the first foreign head of government to visit Democratic Kampuchea, followed soon after by Romania's Nicolae Ceau\u0219escu.\n\n\n==== Number of deaths ====\n\nBen Kiernan estimates that 1.671 million to 1.871 million Cambodians died as a result of Khmer Rouge policy, or between 21% and 24% of Cambodia's 1975 population. A study by French demographer Marek Sliwinski calculated slightly fewer than 2 million unnatural deaths under the Khmer Rouge out of a 1975 Cambodian population of 7.8 million; 33.5% of Cambodian men died under the Khmer Rouge compared to 15.7% of Cambodian women. According to a 2001 academic source, the most widely accepted estimates of excess deaths under the Khmer Rouge range from 1.5 million to 2 million, although figures as low as 1 million and as high as 3 million have been cited; conventionally accepted estimates of deaths due to Khmer Rouge executions range from 500,000 to 1 million, \"a third to one half of excess mortality during the period\". However, a 2013 academic source (citing research from 2009) indicates that execution may have accounted for as much as 60% of the total, with 23,745 mass graves containing approximately 1.3 million suspected victims of execution.While considerably higher than earlier and more widely accepted estimates of Khmer Rouge executions, the Documentation Center of Cambodia (DC-Cam)'s Craig Etcheson defended such estimates of over one million executions as \"plausible, given the nature of the mass grave and DC-Cam's methods, which are more likely to produce an under-count of bodies rather than an over-estimate.\" Demographer Patrick Heuveline estimated that between 1.17 million and 3.42 million Cambodians died unnatural deaths between 1970 and 1979, with between 150,000 and 300,000 of those deaths occurring during the civil war. Heuveline's central estimate is 2.52 million excess deaths, of which 1.4 million were the direct result of violence. Despite being based on a house-to-house survey of Cambodians, the estimate of 3.3 million deaths promulgated by the Khmer Rouge's successor regime, the People's Republic of Kampuchea (PRK), is generally considered to be an exaggeration; among other methodological errors, the PRK authorities added the estimated number of victims that had been found in the partially-exhumed mass graves to the raw survey results, meaning that some victims would have been double-counted.An estimated 300,000 Cambodians starved to death between 1979 and 1980, largely as a result of the after-effects of Khmer Rouge policies.\n\n\n=== Fall of Democratic Kampuchea ===\n\nIn December 1976, the Cambodian Central Committee's annual plenum proposed the country ready itself for the prospect of war with Vietnam. Pol Pot believed that Vietnam was committed to expansionism and thus was a threat to Cambodian independence. There were renewed border clashes between Cambodia and Vietnam in early 1977, continuing into April. On 30 April, Cambodian units, backed by artillery fire, entered Vietnam and attacked a series of villages, killing several hundred Vietnamese civilians. Vietnam responded by ordering its Air Force to bomb Cambodian border positions. Several months later, the fighting resumed; in September, two divisions of the Cambodian Eastern Zone entered the Tay Ninh area of Vietnam, where they attacked several villages and slaughtered their inhabitants. That month, Pol Pot travelled to Beijing, and from there to North Korea, where Kim Il Sung spoke out against Vietnam in solidarity with the Khmer Rouge.\n\nIn December, Vietnam sent 50,000 troops over the border along a 100-mile stretch, penetrating 12 miles into Cambodia. Cambodia then formally broke off diplomatic relations with Vietnam. Cambodian forces fought back against the invaders, who had withdrawn to Vietnam by 6 January 1978. At this point, Pol Pot ordered Cambodia's military to take an aggressive, proactive stance, attacking Vietnamese troops before the latter had the chance to act. The Vietnamese Politburo then concluded that it must not leave Pol Pot in power, but must remove him from power before the Cambodian military strengthened further. In 1978, it established military training camps for Cambodian refugees in southern Vietnam. The Cambodian government also readied itself for war. Plans for a personality cult revolving around Pol Pot were drawn up, based on the Chinese and North Korean models, in the belief that such a cult would unify the population in wartime. The cult was ultimately never implemented.The failure of Cambodian troops in the Eastern Zone to successfully resist the Vietnamese incursion made Pol Pot suspicious of their allegiances. He ordered a purge of the Eastern Zone, with over 400 CPK cadres from the area being sent to S-21. Aware that they would be killed on Pol Pot's orders, increasing numbers of Eastern Zone troops began rebelling against the Khmer Rouge government. Pol Pot sent more troops into the Eastern Zone to defeat the rebels, ordering them to slaughter the inhabitants of any villages that were believed to be harbouring any rebel forces. This suppression in the east was, according to Short, \"the bloodiest single episode under Pol Pot's rule\". Fleeing the government troops, many leading rebels\u2014including Zone deputy chiefs Heng Samrin and Pol Saroeun\u2014made it into Vietnam, where they joined the anti-Pol Pot exile community. By August 1978, Pol Pot could only consider Mok's forces in the south-west and Pauk's in the Central Zone as being reliable.Early in 1978, Pol Pot's government began trying to improve relations with various foreign countries, such as Thailand, to bolster its position against Vietnam. Many other governments in Southeast Asia sympathised with Cambodia's situation, fearing the impact of Vietnamese expansionism and Soviet influence on their own countries. Although supportive of the Cambodians, the Chinese government decided not to send its army into Cambodia, fearing that an all-out conflict with Vietnam could provoke a war with the Soviet Union. Meanwhile, Vietnam was planning its full-scale invasion of Cambodia. In December 1978, it formally launched the Khmer National United Front for National Salvation (KNUFNS), a group made up of Cambodian exiles which it hoped to install in place of the Khmer Rouge. Initially, KNUFNS was headed by Heng Samrin. Fearing this Vietnamese threat, Pol Pot wrote an anti-Vietnamese tract titled the Black Paper.In September 1978, Pol Pot began increasingly courting Sihanouk in the hope that the latter could prove a rallying point in support of the Khmer Rouge government. That same month, Pol Pot flew to China to meet with Deng. Deng condemned Vietnamese aggression but suggested that the Khmer Rouge had precipitated the conflict by being too radical in its policies and by allowing Cambodian troops to behave anarchically along the border with Vietnam. On returning to Cambodia, in October Pol Pot ordered the country's army to switch tactics, adopting a defensive strategy involving the heavy use of land mines to stop Vietnamese incursions. He also cautioned the army to avoid direct confrontations which would incur heavy losses and instead adopt guerrilla tactics. In November 1978, the CPK held its Fifth Congress. Here, Mok was appointed the third ranked figure in the government, behind Pol Pot and Nuon Chea. Soon after the Congress, two senior government members\u2014Vorn Vet and Kong Sophal\u2014were arrested and sent to S-21. This precipitated another round of purges.\n\n\n=== Vietnamese Invasion: 1978\u20131989 ===\n\nOn 25 December 1978, the Vietnamese Army launched its full-scale invasion. Its columns initially advanced into north-east Cambodia, taking Kratie on 30 December and Stung Treng on 3 January. The Vietnamese main force then entered Cambodia on 1 January 1979, heading along Highways one and seven toward Phnom Penh. Cambodia's forward defences failed to stop them. With an attack on Phnom Penh imminent, in January Pol Pot ordered Sihanouk and his family to be sent to Thailand. The entire diplomatic corps followed shortly after. On 7 January Pol Pot and other senior government figures left the city and drove to Pursat. They spent two days there before moving on to Battambang.After the Khmer Rouge evacuated Phnom Penh, Mok was the only senior government figure left in the city, tasked with overseeing its defence. Nuon Chear ordered the cadres in control of S-21 to kill all remaining inmates prior to it being captured by the Vietnamese. However, the troops guarding the city were unaware how close the Vietnamese Army actually were; the government had concealed the extent of the Vietnamese gains from the population. As the Vietnamese approached, many officers and other soldiers guarding the city fled; the defence was highly disorganised. There were isolated examples of Cambodian villagers killing Khmer Rouge officials in revenge. In January, Vietnam installed a new government under Samrin, composed of Khmer Rouge who had fled to Vietnam to avoid the purges. The new government renamed Cambodia the \"People's Republic of Kampuchea\". Although many Cambodians had initially hailed the Vietnamese as saviours, over time resentment against the occupying force grew.The Khmer Rouge turned to China for support against the invasion. Sary travelled to China via Thailand. There, Deng urged the Khmer Rouge to continue a guerrilla war against the Vietnamese and to establish a broad, non-communist front against the invaders, with a prominent role given to Sihanouk.\nChina sent its vice premier, Geng Biao, to Thailand to negotiate the shipment of arms to the Khmer Rouge through Thailand. China also sent diplomats to stay with the Khmer Rouge encampments near the Thai border. Pol Pot met with these diplomats twice before the Chinese government withdrew them for their safety in March. In China, the Khmer Rouge set up their \"Voice of Democratic Kampuchea\" radio station, which remained their main outlet for communicating with the world. In February, the Chinese attacked northern Vietnam, hoping to draw Vietnamese troops away from the invasion of Cambodia. As well as China, the Khmer Rouge also received the support of the United States and most other non-Marxist southeast Asian countries who feared Vietnamese aggression as a tool of Soviet influence in the region.On 15 January, the Vietnamese reached Sisophon. Pol Pot, Nuon Chea, and Khieu Samphan then moved to Palin on the Thai side of the border, and in late January relocated again, to Tasanh, where Sary joined them. There, on 1 February, they held a Central Committee conference, deciding against Deng's advice about a united front. In the second half of March, the Vietnamese moved to hem in the Khmer Rouge along the Thai border, at which many of Pol Pot's troops crossed into Thailand itself. The Vietnamese advanced on Tasanh, which the Khmer Rouge leaders fleeing only a few hours before it was captured.\n\n\n== After Democratic Kampuchea ==\n\n\n=== Fighting back against the Vietnamese: 1979\u20131989 ===\n\nIn July 1979, Pol Pot established a new headquarters, Office 131, on the western flank of Mount Thom. He dropped the name \"Pol Pot\" and began calling himself \"Phem\". In September 1979, Kheiu announced that the Khmer Rouge was establishing a new united front, the Patriotic Democratic Front, bringing together all Cambodians who opposed the Vietnamese occupation. Senior Khmer Rouge members began disavowing the cause of socialism. The group members stopped wearing uniform black outfits; Pol Pot himself started wearing jungle green fatigues and later Thai-made safari suits. Short believed that these changes reflected a genuine ideological shift in the Khmer Rouge. In October, Pol Pot ordered an end to executions, a command which was largely followed. In November 1979, the United Nations General Assembly voted to recognise the Khmer Rouge delegation, rather than that of the Vietnamese-backed government, as the legitimate government of Cambodia. In December, Samph\u00e2n replaced Pol Pot as prime minister of Democratic Kampuchea, a move that allowed Pol Pot to focus on the war effort and which was perhaps also designed to improve the Khmer Rouge's image.During the monsoons of summer 1979, the Khmer Rouge troops began filtering back into Cambodia. Many young Cambodians joined the Khmer Rouge forces, wanting to drive the Vietnamese Army out. Boosted by the new Chinese supplies, the Khmer Rouge rebuilt its military structure in early 1980. By mid-1980, the Khmer Rouge claimed it had 40,000 troops active in Cambodia. From 1981, Pol Pot's main goal was to attract popular support among the Cambodian population, believing that this would be vital in enabling him to win the war. In August 1981, he travelled, via Bangkok, to Beijing, where he met with Deng and Zhao Ziyang. Deng had been pushing for Sihanouk, living in Pyongyang, to become Cambodian head of state, something the monarch had reluctantly agreed to in February 1981. In September, Sihanouk, Samph\u00e2n, and Son Sann issued a joint statement in Singapore announcing the formation of their own coalition government.In December 1981, Pol Pot and Nuon Chea decided to dissolve the Communist Party of Kampuchea, a decision taken with very little discussion among the party's membership, some of whom were shocked. Many outside commentators believed the dissolution was a ruse, and that the CPK was actually going underground once more, although Short noted that this was not the case. Pol Pot proposed a new Movement of Nationalists that would replace the party, although this failed to fully materialise. The CPK Standing Committee was replaced by a Military Directorate, the focus of which was on driving out the Vietnamese. Pol Pot's decision to disband the party was informed by global events; his anti-Vietnamese army was backed by many capitalist countries while the Vietnamese were backed by most Marxist-governed countries. At the same time, he believed that his main Marxist backers, the Chinese, were themselves restoring capitalism with Deng's reforms. Reflecting the ideological shift, among the Khmer Rouge, collective eating was ended, the ban on individual possessions was lifted, and children were again allowed to live with their parents. Pol Pot commented that his previous administration had been too left-wing and claimed that it had made mistakes because he had placed too much trust in treacherous individuals around him.In June 1982, at an event in Kuala Lumpur, the Khmer Rouge were among the factions declaring the formation of a Coalition Government of Democratic Kampuchea (CGDK) as an alternative to the administration in Phnom Penh. On the ground in Cambodia there nevertheless remained little military collaboration between these factions, which included the Khmer Rouge as well as the Sihanoukist National Army and Son Senn's National Front for the Liberation of the Khmer People. In 1983, Pol Pot travelled to Bangkok for a medical check-up; there he was diagnosed with Hodgkin's disease. In mid-1984, Office 131 was moved to a new base further into Cambodia, near the O'Suosaday river. In December, the Vietnamese Army launched a major offensive, overrunning the Khmer Rouge's Cambodian basis and pushing Pol Pot back into Thailand. There, he established a new base, K-18, several miles outside Trat.In September 1985, Pol Pot resigned as commander-in-chief of the Khmer Rouge forces in favour of Son Sen; he nevertheless continued to wield significant influence. In the summer he married a young woman named Mea; the following spring their daughter, Sitha, was born. He then travelled to Beijing to undergo cancer treatment at a military hospital, only returning to Cambodia in the summer of 1988. In 1988, the anti-Vietnamese factions entered into negotiations with the Phnom Penh government. Pol Pot deemed this too soon, for he feared that the Khmer Rouge had not gained sufficient popular support to produce significant gains in any post-war election.\n\n\n=== Fall of the Khmer Rouge: 1990\u20131998 ===\nThe fall of the Berlin Wall and the subsequent end of the Cold War had repercussions for Cambodia. With the Soviet Union no longer a threat, the U.S. and its allies no longer saw Vietnamese domination of Cambodia as an issue. The U.S. announced that it no longer recognised the CGDK as the legitimate government of Cambodia at the UN General Assembly. In June, the various Cambodian factions agreed a ceasefire, to be overseen by the United Nations, with the formation of a new Supreme National Council to facilitate the implementation of democratic elections. Pol Pot agreed to these terms, fearing that if he refused the other factions would all unite against the Khmer Rouge. In November, Sihanouk returned to Cambodia. There, he praised the Vietnamese-backed leader, Hun Sen, and stated that the Khmer Rouge's leaders should be put on trial for their crimes. When Samph\u00e2n arrived in Phnom Penh with the Khmer Rouge's delegation, he was beaten by a mob.Pol Pot established a new headquarter along the border, near Pailin. He called on the Khmer Rouge to redouble their efforts in gaining support across Cambodia's villages. In June, Samph\u00e2n announced that in contravention of earlier agreements its troops would not disarm, stating that it refused to do so while Vietnamese soldiers remained in Cambodia. The Khmer Rouge became increasingly confrontational, expanding its territory across western Cambodia. It carried out massacres of the Vietnamese settlers who had recently arrived in the area. Hun Sen's forces also carried out military activities, with UN peacekeepers proving ineffective in preventing the violence. In January 1993, Sihanouk returned to Beijing, declaring that Cambodia was unprepared for elections. The Khmer Rouge had formed a new party, the Cambodian National Union Party, through which it could take part in the election, but in March Pol Pot announced that they would boycott the vote. At this point he moved his headquarters to Phnom Chhat; Samph\u00e2n joined him there, having withdrawn his Khmer Rouge delegation from Phnom Penh.In the May 1993 elections, Norodom Ranariddh's FUNCINPEC won 58 of the 120 available seats in the National Assembly; Hun Sen's Cambodian People's Party came second. Sun, who was backed by the Vietnamese, refused to acknowledge defeat. Sihanouk negotiated the formation of a coalition government between the two parties, introducing a system whereby Cambodia would have two prime ministers, Ranariddh and Sen. The new Cambodian National Army then launched an offensive against the Khmer Rouge. By August, it had captured Phnom Chhat, with Pol Pot fleeing back into Thailand. The Khmer Rouge launched a counter-offensive, having regained much of the territory they recently lost by May 1994. Pol Pot moved to Anlong Veng, but as that was overrun in 1994 he relocated to Kbal Ansoang, on the crest of the Dangrek Mountains. The Khmer Rouge nevertheless faced growing levels of desertion over the first half of the 1990s.Pol Pot placed renewed emphasis on those living in Khmer Rouge territory imitating the lives of the poorest peasants and in 1994 ordered the confiscation of private transport and an end to cross-border trade with Thailand. In September he ordered the execution of a Briton, a Frenchman, and an Australian who had been captured in a Khmer Rouge attack on a train. In July 1996, a mutiny broke out among the Khmer Rouge and in August it was announced that Ieng Sary, Y Chhean, and Sok Pheap were breaking away from the movement, taking with troops loyal to them. This meant that around 4000 soldiers left, almost halving the troop forces that the Khmer Rouge then commanded. By the end of 1996, the Khmer Rouge had lost almost all the territory they held in the interior of Cambodia, being restricted to a few hundred miles along the northern border. Pol Pot commented to his aides: \"We are like a fish in a trap. We cannot last like this for very long\". Pol Pot's health was declining. He suffered from aortic stenosis and no longer had access to follow-up treatment for his earlier cancer. A stroke left him paralysed on the left side of his body, and he eventually required daily access to oxygen. He spent increasing amounts of time with his family, in particular his daughter.\n\n\n=== Imprisonment and death: 1997\u20131998 ===\n\nPol Pot had grown suspicious of Son Sen and in June 1997 ordered his death. Khmer Rouge cadres subsequently killed Son and 13 of his family members and aides; Pol Pot later stated that he had not sanctioned all of these killings. Ta Mok was concerned that Pol Pot could turn on him too. Mok rallied troops loyal to him at Anlogn Veng, informing them that Pol Pot had betrayed their movement and then headed to Kbal Ansoang. Fearing Mok's troops, on 12 June Pol Pot, his family, and several bodyguards fled on foot. Pol Pot was very frail and had to be carried. After Mok's troops apprehended them, Pol Pot was placed under house arrest. Khieu Samph\u00e2n and Nuon Chea sided with Mok.In late July, Pol Pot and the three Khmer Rouge commanders who remained loyal to him were brought before a mass meeting near Sang'nam. The U.S. journalist Nate Thayer was invited to film the event. There, the Khmer Rouge sentenced Pol Pot to life imprisonment; the three other commanders were sentenced to death. Three months later, Ta Mok permitted Thayer to visit and interview Pol Pot.On 15 April 1998, Pol Pot died in his sleep, apparently of heart failure. His body was preserved with ice and formaldehyde so that his death could be verified by journalists attending his funeral. Three days later, his wife cremated his body on a pyre of tyres and rubbish, utilising traditional Buddhist funerary rites.\nThere were suspicions that he had committed suicide by taking an overdose of the medication which he had been prescribed. Thayer, who was present, held the view that Pol Pot killed himself when he became aware of Ta Mok's plan to hand him over to the United States, saying that \"Pol Pot died after ingesting a lethal dose of a combination of Valium and chloroquine\".\nIn May, Pol Pot's widow and Tep Khunnal fled to Malay, where they married. The Khmer Rouge themselves continued to face territorial losses to the Cambodian Army and in March 1999 Ta Mok was also captured.\n\n\n== Political ideology ==\n\nPol Pot considered himself a communist, and described his CPK as adhering to a \"Marxist\u2013Leninist viewpoint\", albeit one that had been adapted to Cambodian conditions. He took up ideas of orthodox Marxism\u2013Leninism but, contrary to Marx and Lenin's concepts, he believed in the ideal of an entirely self-sufficient and agrarian socialist society that would be entirely free from all foreign influences. Joseph Stalin's work has been described as a \"crucial formative influence\" on Pol Pot. Even more influential was the work of Mao Zedong, particularly his New Democracy. Following Mao's thoughts and political example, in the mid-1960s Pol Pot reformulated his ideas about Marxism\u2013Leninism to better suit the Cambodian situation. Due to these alterations, various other Marxist\u2013Leninists said that he was not truly adhering to Marxist\u2013Leninist ideas. In 1979, Deng for instance criticised the Khmer Rouge for engaging in \"deviations from Marxism-Leninism\".In re-interpreting the revolutionary role of classes and questioning the Marxist focus on the proletariat, Pol Pot embraced the idea of a revolutionary alliance between the peasantry and the intellectuals, an idea that Short linked to his reading of Peter Kropotkin while he was in Paris. Contrary to the principles of historical dialectics, he believed that peasants could develop a proletarian consciousness as an effect of the communist party's education of the masses, which resembles orthodox Marxist\u2013Leninist thought. In addition to that, Philip Short maintained that \"the grammar of Theravada Buddhism permeated\" Pol Pot's thought as much as Confucianism had influenced the development of Maoism in China. According to key Khmer Rouge figure Khieu Samphan, a key concept was \"zero for him, zero for you - that is communism\", in that in a society where all things were the possession of the state and no individual owned anything, everyone would be equal.\n\nShort also thought that the Khmer Rouge's ideology stood apart from other forms of Marxism due to its \"monastic stress on discipline\", with \"the systematic destruction of the individual\" being a \"hallmark\" of its ideology. Pol Pot and the Khmer Rouge believed that in order to crush the individualistic attitude that they thought was endemic in Cambodian society, coercion was needed to ensure the creation of a collectivised state. Short noted that an underlying doctrinal view among the Khmer Rouge was that \"it is always better to go too far than not far enough\", an approach that was \"at the root of many of the abuses\" which occurred under their regime. Within the Communist Party itself, hunger, lack of sleep, and long hours of labour were employed at training camps to ramp up the physical and mental pressure and thus facilitate indoctrination. Short commented that \"no other communist party\" in history ever went \"so far in its attempts directly to remould the minds of its members\".Pol Pot disbanded his Communist Party during the 1980s so as to emphasise a unified national struggle against Vietnamese occupation. That decade, Pol Pot commented that \"We chose communism because we wanted to restore our nation. We helped the Vietnamese, who were communist. But now the communists are fighting us. So we have to turn to the West and follow their way.\" This action led Short to suggest that \"the veneer of Marxism-Leninism which had cloaked Cambodian radicalism had only ever been skin-deep.\"Pol Pot's government was totalitarian.\nPol Pot desired autarky, or complete self-sufficiency, for Cambodia. Short suggested that Pol Pot had been \"an authentic spokesman\" for the yearning that many Khmer felt for \"the return of their former greatness\", the era of the Khmer Empire.\nThe party leadership has been described as xenophobic.\nShort observed that decision-making in Pol Pot's Cambodia was \"unruly\", making it dissimilar from the centralised, organised processes found in other Marxist\u2013Leninist states.\nWithin Democratic Kampuchea, there was much regional and local variation in how party cadres implemented Pol Pot's orders.Pol Pot repeatedly stated or implied that Cambodians were an intrinsically superior group to other ethnic or national groups and that they were immune to foreign influences. Short also noted that the Khmer Rouge generally regarded foreigners as enemies; during the Cambodian civil war, they killed numerous foreign journalists whom they captured, whereas the Vietnamese Marxists typically let them go.\nPol Pot was an extreme nativist, racist and xenophobe who sought to remove all ethnic and religious minorities from Kampuchea. In addition, native religions were banned as part of the Khmer Rouge's attempt to eliminate religion in the country.\n\n\n== Personal life and characteristics ==\nPol Pot had a thirst for power. He was introspective, and highly reclusive. Short stated that he \"delighted in appearing to be what he was not \u2013 a nameless face in the crowd\". During his political career, he used a wide array of pseudonyms: Pouk, Hay, Pol, 87, Grand-Uncle, Elder Brother, First Brother and in later years he used the pseudonyms 99 and Phem. He told a secretary that \"the more often you change your name the better. It confuses the enemy\". In later life he concealed and falsified many details of his life. He never explained why he chose the pseudonym \"Pol Pot\".\n\nPol Pot displayed what Chandler called a \"genteel charisma\", with many observers commenting on his distinctive smile. As a child, his brother characterized him as having been sweet tempered and equable, while fellow school pupils recalled that Pol Pot was mediocre but pleasant. As a teacher, he was characterized by his pupils as having been calm, honest and persuasive, having an \"evident good nature and an attractive personality\". According to Short, Pol Pot's varied and eclectic upbringing meant that he was \"able to communicate naturally with people of all sorts and conditions, establishing an instinctive rapport that invariably made them want to like him\". Pol Pot had a \"magnetic personality\", Short noted. When speaking to audiences he usually carried a fan, which in Cambodian culture was traditionally associated with monkhood.Pol Pot was softly spoken.\nDuring speeches he was serene and calm, even in the midst of using violent rhetoric. Chandler noted that when meeting with people, Pol Pot displayed an \"apparent warmth\" and was known for his \"slowly uttered words\". Kong Duong, who worked with Pol Pot in the 1980s, said that he was \"very likeable, a really nice person. He was friendly, and everything he said seemed very sensible. He would never blame you or scold you to your face.\"He suffered from insomnia, as well as from malaria and intestinal ailments, which left him ill several times a year whilst he was in power. During his childhood, Pol Pot developed a love of music and romantic French poetry, with the work of Paul Verlaine being among his favorites. He was a fan of traditional Khmer music.Chandler suggested that the seven years that Pol Pot primarily spent in jungle encampments among his fellow Marxists had a significant effect on his world-view, and they \"probably reinforced his sense of destiny and self-importance\". Pol Pot had a nationalistic attitude and displayed little interest in events outside Cambodia. \nShort related that \"Pol did believe he was acting for the common good and that sooner or later everyone would recognise that.\"\nShort suggested that Pol Pot, along with other senior members of the Khmer Rouge, engaged in the \"glorification of violence\" and saw bloodshed as a \"cause for exultation\". This, Short suggested, marked the Khmer Rouge's leadership out as being different from those who led the Chinese and Vietnamese Marxist movements, who tended to see violence as a necessary evil rather than something to embrace joyfully.Pol Pot wanted his followers to develop a \"revolutionary consciousness\" that would allow them to act without his guidance and was often disappointed when they failed to display this. Partly because he did not fully trust subordinates he micro-managed events, scrutinising things such as menus for state receptions or the programming schedules for radio broadcasts.\n\n\n== Reception and legacy ==\nIn its obituary notice for Pol Pot, The New York Times referred to him as the creator of \"one of the 20th century's most brutal and radical regimes\". \nBoth the BBC News and Time magazine blamed his government for \"one of the worst mass killings of the 20th century\". In 2009, Deutsche Welle described Pol Pot's government as having initiated one of the \"world's most infamous political experiments\", while Short referred to the Khmer Rouge as \"the most radical revolutionary movement of modern times\". Writing for the U.S. socialist magazine Jacobin in 2019, the Dutch socialist Alex de Jong characterised Pol Pot's government as a \"genocidal regime\" and noted that the name of the Khmer Rouge had become \"synonymous with murder and repression\". Many Cambodians who lived through his administration later referred to it as samai a-Pot (\"the era of the contemptible Pot\".)The idea that the deaths which occurred under Pol Pot's government should be considered genocide was first put forward by the Vietnamese government in 1979 after the revelations of the killings committed at Tuol Sleng prison. Short argued that while Pol Pot's administration was clearly responsible for crimes against humanity, it was misleading to accuse it of genocide because it never sought to eradicate an entire population.Various Marxist\u2013Leninist groups endorsed Pol Pot's government while it was in power. The small Canadian Communist League (Marxist\u2013Leninist), for instance, praised his government and sent a delegation to meet with him in Phnom Penh in December 1978. Another sympathiser who visited Pol Pot that year was the Scottish communist Malcolm Caldwell, an economic historian based at London's School of Oriental and African Studies. He met with Pol Pot, but was murdered shortly afterward; the culprit was never identified. Also in 1978, the Khmer Rouge met with delegates of the Swedish Cambodian Friendship Association, whose members openly sympathised with Pol Pot's regime. One of its members, Gunnar Bergstrom, later noted that in the 1970s he had been a Marxist\u2013Leninist who had become dissatisfied with the Soviet Union and believed that the Cambodian government was building a society based on freedom and equality. In his view, the Khmer Rouge regime was \"an example to the Third World\". Bergstrom noted that he and his fellow members had heard about atrocities that were taking place but \"did not want to believe them\". Bergstrom later renounced communism; in 2008 he returned to Cambodia for a tour during which he publicly apologised for supporting the regime.\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n=== Footnotes ===\n\n\n=== Sources ===\n\n\n== Further reading ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n\nA meeting with Pol Pot.

'City of the Brahma's Faces') or shortly known as Krong Chaktomuk (Khmer: \u1780\u17d2\u179a\u17bb\u1784\u1785\u178f\u17bb\u1798\u17bb\u1781), is the capital and most populous city in Cambodia. Phnom Penh has been the national capital since French colonization of Cambodia, and has grown to become the nation's economic, industrial, and cultural center.\nOnce known as the \"Pearl of Asia,\" it was considered one of the loveliest French-built cities in Indochina in the 1920s. Phnom Penh, along with Siem Reap and Sihanoukville, are significant global and domestic tourist destinations for Cambodia. Founded in 1372, the city is noted for its historical architecture and attractions. It became the national capital in 1434 following the fall of Angkor, and remained so until 1497. It regained its capital status during the French colonial era in 1865. There are a number of surviving French colonial buildings scattered along the grand boulevards.\nOn the banks of the Tonl\u00e9 Sap, Mekong, and Bassac Rivers, Phnom Penh is home to more than 2 million people, approximately 14% of the Cambodian population.\n\n\n== Etymology ==\nPhnom Penh (literally, 'Penh's Hill') takes its name from the present Wat Phnom ('Hill Temple'). Legend has it that in 1372, a wealthy widow named Lady Penh found a Koki tree floating down the Tonle Sap river after a storm. Inside the tree were four bronze Buddha statues and a stone statue of Vishnu. Daun Penh ordered villagers to raise the height of the hill northeast of her house and used the Koki wood to build a temple on the hill to house the four Buddha statues, and a shrine for the Vishnu image slightly lower down. The temple became known as Wat Phnom Daun Penh, which is now known as Wat Phnom, a small hill 27 metres (89 ft) in height.\nPhnom Penh's official name, in its short form, is Krong Chaktomok (Khmer: \u1780\u17d2\u179a\u17bb\u1784\u1785\u178f\u17bb\u1798\u17bb\u1781) meaning \"City of Four Faces\".

This loosely translates as \"The place of four rivers that gives the happiness and success of Khmer Kingdom, the highest leader as well as impregnable city of the God Indra of the great kingdom\".\n\n\n== History ==\nFirst recorded a century after it is said to have taken place, the legend of the founding of Phnom Penh tells of a local woman, Penh (commonly referred to as Daun Penh (\"Grandmother Penh\" or \"Old Lady Penh\") in Khmer), living at Chaktomuk, the future Phnom Penh. It was the late 14th century, and the Khmer capital was still at Angkor near Siem Reap 350 km (217 mi) to the north. Gathering firewood along the banks of the river, Lady Penh spied a floating koki tree in the river and fished it from the water. Inside the tree she found four Buddha statues and one of Vishnu.\nThe discovery was taken as a divine blessing, and to some a sign that the Khmer capital was to be brought to Phnom Penh from Angkor. To house the new-found sacred objects, Penh raised a small hill on the west bank of the Tonle Sap River and crowned it with a shrine, now known as Wat Phnom at the north end of central Phnom Penh. \"Phnom\" is Khmer for \"hill\" and Penh's hill took on the name of the founder, and the area around it became known after the hill.\nPhnom Penh first became the capital of Cambodia after Ponhea Yat, king of the Khmer Empire, moved the capital from Angkor Thom after it was captured and destroyed by Siam a few years earlier. There is a stupa behind Wat Phnom that houses the remains of Ponhea Yat and the royal family as well as the remaining Buddhist statues from the Angkorean era. In the 17th century, Japanese immigrants also settled on the outskirts of present-day Phnom Penh. A small Portuguese community survived in Phnom Penh until the 17th century, undertaking commercial and religious activity in the country.\nPhnom Penh remained the royal capital for 73 years, from 1432 to 1505. It was abandoned for 360 years (from 1505 to 1865) by subsequent kings due to internal fighting between the royal pretenders. Later kings moved the capital several times and established their royal capitals at various locations in Tuol Basan (Srey Santhor), Pursat, Longvek, Lavear Em and Oudong.\nIt was not until 1866, under the reign of King Norodom I (1860\u20131904), the eldest son of King Ang Duong, who ruled on behalf of Siam, that Phnom Penh became the permanent seat of government and capital of Cambodia, and also where the current Royal Palace was built. Beginning in 1870, the French colonial authorities turned a riverside village into a city where they built hotels, schools, prisons, barracks, banks, public works offices, telegraph offices, law courts, and health services buildings. In 1872, the first glimpse of a modern city took shape when the colonial administration employed the services of French contractor Le Faucheur to construct the first 300 concrete houses for sale and rental to Chinese traders.\nBy the 1920s, Phnom Penh was known as the \"Pearl of Asia\", and over the next four decades, Phnom Penh continued to experience rapid growth with the building of railways to Sihanoukville and Pochentong International Airport (now Phnom Penh International Airport). Phnom Penh's infrastructure saw major modernisation under the rule of Sihanouk.During the Vietnam War, Cambodia was used as a base by the People's Army of Vietnam (PAVN) and the Viet Cong (VC) and thousands of refugees from across the country flooded the city to escape the fighting between their own government troops, the PAVN/VC, the South Vietnamese and its allies and the Khmer Rouge and the American air strikes. By 1975, the population was 2\u20133 million, the bulk of whom were refugees from the fighting. The Khmer Rouge cut off supplies to the city for more than a year before it fell on April 17, 1975. Reports from journalists stated that the Khmer Rouge shelling \"tortured the capital almost continuously,\" inflicting \"random death and mutilation\" on millions of trapped civilians. The Khmer Rouge forcibly evacuated the entire city after taking it, in what has been described as a death march: Fran\u00e7ois Ponchaud wrote that \"I shall never forget one cripple who had neither hands nor feet, writhing along the ground like a severed worm, or a weeping father carrying his ten-year old daughter wrapped in a sheet tied around his neck like a sling, or the man with his foot dangling at the end of a leg to which it was attached by nothing but skin\"; Jon Swain recalled that the Khmer Rouge were \"tipping out patients from the hospitals like garbage into the streets....In five years of war, this is the greatest caravan of human misery I have seen.\" All of its residents, including the wealthy and educated, were evacuated from the city and forced to do difficult labour on rural farms as \"new people\". Tuol Sleng High School was taken over by Pol Pot's forces and was turned into the S-21 prison camp, where people were detained and tortured. Pol Pot sought a return to an agrarian economy and therefore killed many people perceived as educated, \"lazy\" or political enemies. Many others starved to death as a result of failure of the agrarian society and the sale of Cambodia's rice to China in exchange for bullets and weaponry. The former high school is now the Tuol Sleng Genocide Museum, where Khmer Rouge torture devices and photos of their victims are displayed. Choeung Ek (The Killing Fields), 15 kilometers (9 mi) away, where the Khmer Rouge marched prisoners from Tuol Sleng to be murdered and buried in shallow pits, is also now a memorial to those who were killed by the regime.\nThe Khmer Rouge were driven out of Phnom Penh by the PAVN in 1979, and people began to return to the city. Vietnam is historically a state with which Cambodia has had many conflicts, therefore this liberation was and is viewed with mixed emotions by the Cambodians. A period of reconstruction began, spurred by the continuing stability of government, attracting new foreign investment and aid by countries including France, Australia, and Japan. Loans were made from the Asian Development Bank and the World Bank to reinstate a clean water supply, roads and other infrastructure. The 1998 Census put Phnom Penh's population at 862,000; and the 2008 census was 1.3 million.\n\n\n== Geography ==\nPhnom Penh is in the south-central region of Cambodia, and is fully surrounded by Kandal Province. The municipality is on the banks of the Tonl\u00e9 Sap, Mekong, and Bassac Rivers. These rivers provide freshwater and other natural resources to the city. Phnom Penh and the surrounding areas consist of a typical flood plain area for Cambodia. Although Phnom Penh is at 11.89 metres (39 ft) above the river, monsoon season flooding is a problem, and the river sometimes overflows its banks.\nThe city, at 11.55\u00b0N 104.91667\u00b0E\ufeff / 11.55; 104.91667 (11\u00b033' North, 104\u00b055' East), covers an area of 678.46 square kilometres (262 sq mi), with some 11,401 hectares (28,172 acres) in the municipality and 26,106 ha (64,509 acres) of roads. The agricultural land in the municipality amounts to 34.685 km2 (13 sq mi) with some 1.476 km2 (365 acres) under irrigation.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nPhnom Penh has a tropical wet and dry climate (K\u00f6ppen climate classification Aw). The climate is hot year-round with only minor variations. Temperatures typically range from 22 to 35 \u00b0C (72 to 95 \u00b0F) and weather is subject to the tropical monsoons. The southwest monsoon blows inland bringing moisture-laden winds from the Gulf of Thailand and Indian Ocean from May to November. The northeast monsoon ushers in the dry season, which lasts from December to April. The city experiences the heaviest precipitation from September to October with the driest period in January and February.\nThe city has two distinct seasons. The rainy season, which runs from May to November, sees high temperatures accompanied by high humidity. The dry season lasts from December to April; when overnight temperatures can drop to 22 \u00b0C (72 \u00b0F).\n\n\n== Administration ==\n\nPhnom Penh is a municipality of area 678.46 square kilometres (261.95 sq mi) with a government status equal to that of Cambodian provinces. The municipality is divided into 14 administrative divisions called khans (sections). The sections are subdivided into 105 sangkats (quarters), and further subdivided into 953 phums (villages).  All khans are under the governance of the Phnom Penh Municipality. Dangkao, Meanchey, Porsenchey, Sen Sok and Russei Keo are considered the outskirts of the city.\nThe municipality is governed by the governor who acts as the top executive of the city as well as overseeing the Municipal Military Police, Municipal Police, and Bureau of Urban Affairs. Below the governor is the first vice governor and five vice governors. The chief of cabinet, who holds the same status as the vice governors, heads the cabinet consisting of eight deputy chiefs of cabinet who in turn are in charge of the 27 administrative departments. Every khan (district) also has a chief.\n\n\n== Demographics ==\nAs of 2019, Phnom Penh had a population of 2,129,371 people, with a total population density of 3,136 inhabitants per square kilometre in a 679 square kilometres (262 sq mi) city area. The population growth rate of the city is 3.92%. The city area has grown fourfold since 1979, and the metro area will continue to expand in order to support the city's growing population and economy.\nPhnom Penh is mostly inhabited by Cambodians (or Khmers). They represent 90% of the population of the city. There are large minorities of Chinese, Vietnamese, and other small ethnic groups who are Thai, Budong, Mnong Preh, Kuy, Chong, and Chams. The state religion is Theravada Buddhism. More than 90% of the people in Phnom Penh are Buddhists. Chams have been practicing Islam for hundreds of years. Since 1993, there has also been an increase in the practice of Christianity which was practically wiped out after 1975 when the Khmer Rouge took over. The official language is Khmer, but English and French are widely used in the city.\nThe number of slum-inhabitants at the end of 2012 was 105,771, compared with 85,807 at the start of 2012.Note: As stated in the \"History\" paragraph (The 1998 Census put Phnom Penh's population at 862,000; and the 2008 census was 1.3 million.) the information collides with the information provided in the \"Historical population\" table. Needs editing.\n\n\n== Politics ==\n\n \nPhnom Penh is allocated 12 seats in the National Assembly, making it the largest constituency.\n\n\n=== Members of Parliament ===\n\n\n== Economy ==\n\nPhnom Penh is Cambodia's economic centre as it accounts for a large portion of the Cambodian economy. Double-digit economic growth rates in recent years have triggered an economic boom in Phnom Penh, with new hotels, restaurants, schools, bars, high rises and residential buildings springing up in the city.\nThe economy is based on commercial interests such as garments, trading, and small and medium enterprises. In the past few years the property business has been booming, with rapidly increasing real estate prices. Tourism is also a major contributor in the capital as more shopping and commercial centres open, making Phnom Penh one of the major tourist destinations in South East Asia along with Siem Reap and Sihanoukville. According to the World Travel and Tourism Council, tourism made up 19.2 percent (US$2,053 million) of Cambodia's GDP in 2009 and accounts for 13.7 percent of total employment. One of the most popular areas in Phnom Penh for tourists is Sisowath Quay, alongside the Tonle Sap River. Sisowath Quay is a five kilometre strip of road that includes restaurants, bars, and hotels.The US$2.6 billion new urban development, Camko City, is meant to bolster the city landscape. The Bureau of Urban Affairs of Pnochina Penh Municipality has plans to expand and construct new infrastructure to accommodate the growing population and economy. High rise buildings will be chinesely constructed at the entrance of the city and near the lakes and riverbanks. Furthermore, new roads, canals, and a railway system will be used to connect Camko City and Phnom Penh.\nOther projects include:\n\nGrand Phnom Penh International City (under construction)\nDe Castle Royal Condominium (Completed)\nGold Tower 42 (On hold 32 floors construction begins again in the mid of 2018)\nOCIC Tower (Completed)\nKokling super second floor house\nVattanac Capital Tower (completed)\nThe Bridge (Completed)\nThe Peak (under construction)\nWith booming economic growth seen since the 1990s, new shopping venues have opened: Sorya Center Point, Aeon Mall Phnom Penh, Aeon Mall Sen Sok City, Olympia Mall, and Parkson Mall (under construction). Many international brands have opened such as Mango, Salvatore Ferragamo, Hugo Boss, Padini Concept Store, Lily, Timberland, Jimmy Choo, CC Double O, MO, Brands Outlet, Nike, Converse, Pony, Armani Exchange, and Super Dry.\nThe tallest skyscraper in Phnom Penh is Vattanac Capital Tower at a height of 188 metres (617 ft), dominating Phnom Penh's skyline with its neighbour skyscraper Canadia Tower (OCIC Tower). The tower was completed in December 2014. Modern high rises have been constructed all around the city, not concentrated in any one particular area.\nThe Central Market Phsar Thmei is a tourist attraction. The four wings of the yellow colored market are teeming with numerous stalls selling gold and silver jewelry, antique coins, clothing, clocks, flowers, food, fabrics and shoes. Phsar Thmei is undergoing under a major renovation, along with the creation of newer stalls.\n\n\n== Education ==\n\n\n=== Universities and colleges ===\n\n\n=== Primary and secondary schools ===\n\n\n=== International schools ===\n\n\n=== Supplementary and extra schools ===\nThe Japanese Supplementary School of Phnom Penh , formerly known in English as the Phnom Penh Japanese School, is a part-time Japanese School, operated by the Japanese Association of Cambodia (JACAM;\u30ab\u30f3\u30dc\u30b8\u30a2\u65e5\u672c\u4eba\u4f1a Kambojia Nihonjin-kai). It is in Sangkat Toek Thla in Sen Sok. It was established in 2002. It had 60 students in June 2011.\n\n\n== Culture ==\nPhnom Penh also has its own dialect of Khmer. Speakers of the Phnom Penh dialect often elide syllables, which has earned it the reputation for being lazy speech. Phnom Penh is also known for its influence on New Khmer Architecture. Phnom Penh is notable for Ka tieu Phnom Penh, its variation on rice noodle soup, a dish available in sit-down cafes as well as street cafes.\nMusic and the arts are making a revival throughout Cambodia, especially in Phnom Penh. Phnom Penh currently hosts a number of music events throughout the city. 'Indie' bands (those without corporate sponsors) have grown in number due also in part to the emergence of private music schools such as SoundsKool Music (also operating in the city of Siem Reap), and Music Arts School (registered as an NGO).\nThe two most visited museums in the city are the National Museum, which is the country's leading historical and archaeological museum, and Tuol Sleng Genocide Museum, a former Khmer Rouge prison. The National Museum hosts celebrations of Cambodian dance and music, including a popular classic Apsara dance show of traditional folk dances as well as original creations.\nChaul Chnam Thmey April 13\u201315\n\nAt this time, Phnom Penh celebrates Cambodian New Year, an occasion increasingly popular with tourists. During this typically hottest part of the year, water gets thrown around adding to the party atmosphere along with dancing and music. The precise date changes year-by-year but this holiday lasts, at least, three days. This festival marks the turn of the year based on the ancient Khmer calendar and also marks the end of the prior year harvest.\nWater Festival November\n\nThe largest annual festival in Phnom Penh, this lively gathering celebrates the reversing of the flow of the Tonl\u00e9 Sap River. The holiday lasts three days as people flood into the city to enjoy the fireworks, boat races, live concerts, eating and partying. The boat racing dates back to ancient times marking the strengths of the Khmer marine forces during the Khmer Empire.\nOn 22 November 2010 at least 348 people were crushed to death in a bridge stampede at the festival.Pchum Ben October 11\u201315 (2012)\nPchum Ben is a very important aspect of Cambodian culture. It may be translated as \"gathering together\" to make offerings and is a time of reunion, commemoration, express love and appreciation for one's ancestors. By offering food and good karma to those possibly trapped in the spirit world, living relatives help assuage their misery and guide them back into the cycle of reincarnation.\nVisak Bochea May\n\nVes\u0101kha is an annual holiday observed traditionally by Buddhists in Cambodia. Sometimes informally called \"Buddha's Birthday\", it actually encompasses the birth, enlightenment (nirv\u0101\u1e47a), and passing away (Parinirv\u0101na) of Gautama Buddha.\n\n\n== Cityscape and architecture ==\n\nThe oldest structure is Wat Phnom from the founding days of the city, constructed in 1373. The main tourist attractions are the Royal Palace with the Silver Pagoda, and the National Museum, constructed during the French colonial era in the late-19th century in the classical Khmer style and hosting a vast collection of Khmer antiquities. The Independence Monument (Khmer: Vimean Akareach), although from the 1950s, is also constructed in the ancient Khmer style.\nThe French, who were the colonial masters from the 19th century to the 1940s, also left their mark, with various colonial villas, French churches, boulevards, and the Art Deco market Phsar Thom Thmei. A notable landmark of the colonial era is the Hotel Le Royal.\n\nStarting with independence from the French in the 1950s and lasting until the era of the Khmer Rouge in the 1970s, Phnom Penh underwent tremendous growth as the capital city of a newly independent country. King Sihanouk was eager to present a new style of architecture and thus invigorate the process of nation building. A new golden era of architecture took off, with various projects and young Khmer architects, often educated in France, given opportunities to design and construct. This new movement was called \"New Khmer Architecture\" and was often characterised by a fusion of Bauhaus, European post-modern architecture, and traditional elements from Angkor. The most prominent architect was Vann Molyvann, who was nominated chief national architect by the king himself in 1956. Molyvann created landmark buildings such as the Preah Suramarit National Theatre and the Council of Ministers building. Other architects helped construct the newly founded Royal Khmer University, the Institute of Foreign Languages, and the National Sports Centre. With the growth of the upper and entrepreneurial middle classes, new suburbs were built in the 1950s and 1960s. Although these buildings survived the Khmer Rouge era and the civil war, today they are under threat due to economic development and financial speculation. Villas and gardens from that era are being destroyed and redeveloped to make place for bigger structures. The landmark National Theatre by Molyvann was razed in 2008. A movement is rising in Cambodia to preserve this modernist heritage. Old villas are sometimes being converted into boutique hotels, such as the Knai Bang Chatt. \nMonuments and memorials to the genocide of the Khmer Rouge era in the 1970s are the Tuol Sleng Genocide Museum (a former high school used as a concentration camp) and, on the outskirts of the city, the Choeung Ek Genocide Center. The Cambodia-Vietnam Friendship Monument was commissioned by the Vietnamese communists as symbol of Khmer-Vietnamese friendship during the late-1970s following the liberation of Cambodia from the Khmer Rouge.\nThe population, foreign investment, and urban development in Phnom Penh grew dramatically during the 1990s and early-2000s. The rapid growth resulted in the city's infrastructure distinctly lacking (the drainage system is particularly notorious, and Phnom Penh frequently floods during the wet season), and a need for both residential and commercial spaces. The simultaneous demand for residential and commercial housing and the increase of international investment has led to the planning, if not construction, of several satellite cities. The largest of these cities are: Grand Phnom Penh International City, CamKo City, Diamond Island City, Boeung Kak Town, and Chruy Cangva City.\nOn the outskirts of the city, farmland has been developed into garment factories and housing for lower economic classes and those displaced by the new development in the city center.\n\n\n=== 2035 master plan ===\nOriginally intended to be completed by 2020, the 2035 master plan is a French-funded project for the development of Phnom Penh. Although the plan was approved by the Ministry of Land Management, Urban Planning and Construction in 2005, it has yet to be ratified by the Cabinet of Cambodia. The original plan details five edge-city projects connected to the historical city centre by waterways and tree-lined corridors.\n\n\n== Media ==\n\n\n=== Dailies ===\n\n\n==== Khmer ====\nSralagn' Khmer (Love Khmer)\nChakraval Daily (Universe)\nKampuchea Thmei Daily (New Cambodia)\nKampuchea Tgnai Nis (Cambodia Today)\nKanychok Sangkhum (Social Reflection)\nKoh Santepheap (Island of Peace)\nMoneaksekar Khmer (Khmer Conscience) \u2013 Published by the Sam Rainsy Party.\nRasmei Kampuchea (Light of Kampuchea) \u2013 Cambodia's largest daily, it circulates about 18,000 copies.\nSamleng Yuvachun (Voice of Khmer Youth)\nUdomkate Khmer (Khmer Ideal)\nWat Phnom Daily (Mount Temple)\n\n\n==== English ====\nPhnom Penh Post, a daily English-language newspaper published in Phnom Penh.\nThe Cambodia Daily, an English-language daily newspaper (closed in 2017).\nThe Khmer Times, an English-language daily newspaper.\n\n\n==== Chinese ====\n\u300a\u67ec\u83ef\u65e5\u5831\u300b(Jianhua Daily), a daily Chinese-language newspaper published in Phnom Penh.\n\u300a\u661f\u6d32\u65e5\u5831\u300b(Sin Chew Daily), a Chinese-language daily newspaper, the Cambodian edition of the Malaysian Chinese daily of the same name.\n\u300a\u83ef\u5546\u65e5\u5831\u300b(Huashang Daily), a Chinese-language daily newspaper.\n\u300a\u9ad8\u68c9\u65e5\u62a5\u300b(Khmer Daily), a Chinese-language daily newspaper.\n\u300a\u65b0\u67ec\u57d4\u5be8\u300b(New Cambodia), a Chinese-language daily newspaper.\n\n\n=== Magazines ===\nAsiaLIFE Guide Phnom Penh, a monthly English-language lifestyle magazine published in Phnom Penh.\nPocket Guide Cambodia publishes four separate guides aimed at English-speaking residents and visitors.\nF Magazine, the first fashion-forward magazine in Cambodia.

Cambodia has increasingly become involved in modern sports over the last 30 years. As with the rest of the country, football and the martial arts are particularly popular.  Ultimate fighting and freestyle boxing have also become more common in recent years.The most prominent sporting venue in the city is the Phnom Penh National Olympic Stadium with a capacity of 80,000\u2014although the country never hosted the Olympic Games due to disruption by the civil war and the Khmer Rouge in the 1970s. Built in 1964, it is home to the Cambodian national football team. On completion the stadium was one of the largest in Asia. Today it is the 6th largest stadium in Southeast Asia. Volleyball, basketball, and Tai-Kwon-Do games are often hosted at the stadium.  The stadium closed in 2000, but was redeveloped and reopened.\nThe National Sports Centre of Cambodia hosts swimming, boxing, and volleyball competitions. Noted local football clubs include Phnom Penh Empire, Khemara Keila FC and Military Police.\n\n\n== Transport ==\n\nPhnom Penh International Airport is the largest and busiest airport in Cambodia. It is seven kilometres west of central Phnom Penh. The airport is connected to the city center by taxi, train, and shuttle bus.\nCambodia's national flag carrier, Cambodia Angkor Air, launched in 2009, is headquartered in Phnom Penh and has its main hub there, with an additional hub at the Angkor International Airport.Air France used to serve Phnom Penh from Paris-Charles de Gaulle but this service has since stopped. Qatar Airways now flies to and from Phnom Penh, via Ho Chi Minh City.\nTaxis, pick-ups, and minibuses leave the city for destinations all over the country, but are fast losing ground to cheaper and more comfortable buses. Phnom Penh also has a rail service.\nThere are numerous bus companies, including Phnom Penh Public Transport and GST Express, running services to most provincial capitals, including Sihanoukville, Kampong Chhnang, Oudong and Tak\u00e9o. Phnom Penh Sorya Transport Co. offers bus service to several provincial destinations along the National Routes and to Ho Chi Minh City. Giant Ibis is another bus company based in Phnom Penh, which travels to Sihanoukville, Kampot, Siem Reap and Ho Chi Minh, and has free Wi-Fi, air conditioning and modest pricing.\nThe city is Cambodia's main freshwater port, a major port on the Mekong River. It is linked to the South China Sea, 290 kilometres distant, via a channel of the Mekong in Vietnam.\n\n\n=== Public transport ===\n\nPhnom Penh is served by three air conditioned bus lines. Initial attempts by the Japanese government to develop a Phnom Penh bus service began in 2001. An update of the JICA urban transport master plan for Phnom Penh was completed and implemented in 2014. The city is now served by three bus lines, operated by the Phnom Penh municipal government. Private transportation within the city include the cycle rickshaw, known in Khmer as \"cyclo\", the motorcycle taxi known in Khmer as \"moto\", the auto rickshaw known locally as \"tuk-tuk\", the trailer attached to a motorcycle taxi known in Khmer as \"remorque\", and the standard automobile taxicab known in Khmer as \"taxi\". Private forms of transportation used by locals include bicycles, motorbikes, and cars.\n\n\n=== Highways ===\n\nAs the capital of Cambodia, a number of national highways connect the city with various parts of the country:\n\n\n== Water supply ==\n\nWater supply in Phnom Penh has improved dramatically in terms of access, service quality, efficiency, cost recovery and governance between 1993 and 2006. The number of customers has increased ninefold, service quality has improved from intermittent to continuous supply, water losses have been cut dramatically and the city's water utility went from being bankrupt to making a modest profit. These achievements were recognized through international awards such as the 2006 Ramon Magsaysay Award and the 2010 Stockholm Industry Water Award. The city's water utility is the Phnom Penh Water Supply Authority (PPWSA). Its main water sources are the Mekong River, the Tonle Sap river and the Tonle Bassac river.\n\n\n== International relations ==\n\n\n=== Twin towns and sister cities ===\nPhnom Penh is twinned with:\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of markets in Phnom Penh\nSpecial Economic Zones of Cambodia\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\nGroslier, B.P.

          "The Riverside Park isn\u2019t the nicest walk you can take but it is nicer than most places to walk around in the city in Phnom Penh. The only thing is the temperature. It is just too hot and humid for comfort. I suggest walking down this stretch of city at night and there are more",
          "One can spend a lot of time here. Watch the difference in water where the Tonle Sap and Mekong River joins. Watch sampans in the river and locals fishing. Buy flowers and local food, or simply just spending time with friends while walking along the river.",

          "While there are many fantastic wats to explore in Phnom Penh, Wat Ounalom is one of the most colorful and impressive. From the amazing entrance gate, to the huge gong nearby, to the many ornate stupas on the property, to the temple itself, this wat is one not to miss when in",
          "We were having an evening walk and passed by the temple where we had the chance to meet his holiness Tep Vong. He is a Cambodian Buddhist monk, currently the Great Supreme Patriarch of Cambodia, known for his role in re-establishing the Cambodian monkhood after the Pol Pot",
          "I enjoyed wandering around this temple, it was very quiet with few people around, there is no admission charge for coming in here. Plenty to keep you occupied for an hour",
          "A bright and beautiful temple in the city. if you've some time and like temples, you have to stop here for a couple of mins and also explore it, it is totally free of cost to enter",
          "This temple is near the Grand Palace and also in front of the Quay. A nice temple with interesting statues and carvings.",
          "We came across this temple when walking along the river. Free to enter, quiet & not full of tourists. We spent just short of an hour looking round, into the temple. Worth a look round if your in the area.",
          "After Royal Palace, we go to Pagoda to get blessed by the monk. This one is visited by many tourist because it is near the Riverside. It is a good place to take the children and also to rest before going to next destination",
          "In case you're in this specific region, Wat Ounalom may be worth a trip. Beautiful pristine temple to walk about out of the scorching sun.",
          "Located not too far from the Royal Palace, deff worth the 10 minute walk to see. Many buildings in the complex, and other lovely ornamental things to see, including the massive gong.",
          "I passed by this pagoda on our way to other tourist places in Phnom Penh. It was interesting enough to visit.",
          "Worth a quick stop of you have time. Free entry and quiet contemplative place to enjoy. If you are passing worth going.",
          "As many other tourist spots are located nearby, I highly recommend visiting Wat Qunalom as you stroll along Sisowath Quay. One of the better Wats in Phnom Penh. Bring your camera as there are plenty of photo opportunities around the temple grounds. There also is no entry",
          "Beautiful quick stop, amazing detailing. We had a tour guide so also learnt of the history which was valuable at this destination",
          "Worth having a look at this temple if you are passing, probably one of the more impressive of the temples in Phnom Penh, and so you could combine it with a trip to the Royal Palace.",
          "On a walk down the Sisowan Quay, I stopped to have a look around this temple. It\u2019s a pretty generic Buddhist Temple except it seems to be in large grounds. Around the outside of the temple are various things like an auspicious gong (which only Monks can use), some golden stupas",
          "This is a pretty nice temple, although I was surprised at how small and generic it is, especially considering that this is supposedly the headquarters of Cambodian Buddhism. The only thing that spoiled my visit was being offered tuk-tuks and naughty massages by some very",
          "We were on a day tour in Phnom Penh and this was our first stop. Interesting but not overwhelming. If you have a tour guide they can give some extra information, otherwise I think it will be no more than a 10min visit.",
          "Stop by and get some peace. Temple had chanting and praying going on in the big hall. That was peaceful in itself. Location is very central.",
          "It has an interesting history that goes back many years. The pagoda is filled with smoke from burning sticks.",
          "We were walking around Sisowath Quay and decided to stop in for a short visit. It was extremely hot and humid outside so we didn\u2019t stay for very long. Plus, the main temple seemed to be locked. It was okay because the wat was nicely decorated and the surrounding area was nice.",
          "If you are in this area Wat Ounalom is worth a visit. Lovely clean temple to stroll around out of the hot sun.",
          "another nice and bright temple in the city. if u have time and like temples, u must stop here for few minutes and see it, its free of cost to enter",
          "Wat Ounalom is reputedly the oldest of the five pagodas that have been founded during Phnom Penh\u2019s first era as a capital in the early 15th century. Wat Ounalom is the centre of Cambodian Buddhism and serves as the abode of the Patriarch of the Mahanikai School of Buddhism.",
          "a very nice place to visit. cambodian culture at its best. must be visited once. no need to repeat. free entry.",
          "The temple is in the city center, close to all other attractions, so you may consider visiting - the temple outside is quite interesting, with many sculptures and other interesting sights. Unfortunately, the main temple is not very exciting inside - there are some Buddha statues",
          "Not much to say here but the place is quite pretty from afar. We only took a picture outside and went to someplace else",
          "Wat Ounalom is the seat of the Buddhist patriarch of Cambodia and is thought to be the oldest Buddhist foundation in Phnom Penh, parts of it dating back to the 15th century. An old wooden sign at the entrance to the main temple welcomes foreigners as well as locals for \"quiet",
          "This temple is situated in City center. and very near to Royal Palace as well. A beautiful place with many sculptures and paintings.",
          "Ounalum is an easy to visit temple due to its location in Phom Penh. Its beautifull, so its recommended to visit. Because of the location on a hill, you'll also have a nice view on the surroundings of the temple.",
          "We visited here yesterday as part of a sightseeing tour. We just walk around because it was already closed, but it is beautiful. Many tuktuk drivers pick up their guests here.",
          "Ladies have a dress code... even shawl is not allowed, need to wear T Shirt and Jean/Slacks. Entrance fee a bit costly, not much of a shelter when it rains or when its scorching hot from the sun... a LOT of walking... not advisable to those who can't walk much",
          "a simple pagoda, nothing special. some areas seem abandones and there are many dogs. there are other more interesting places to visit if you have limited period of time in phnompenh",
          "Easy enough to find by the riverside. Large temple which is free to enter. Pretty enough to wander around for a short while.",
          "I came here in the late afternoon. Because so many tourists inside for praying, I didn't go. Just returned in the gate and walking around for waiting sunset.",
          "Compared to Wat Phnom, this wat is definitely more worth paying a visit. It is larger and it is better maintained.",
          "I enjoyed visiting this temple. Although it's not huge, there was lots to look at that was interesting to a tourist like myself. I would definately recommend stopping by, especially as it's so close to the waterfront and the Royal Palace. It's also free to enter.",
          "...near the Royal Palace and the tourist area along Sisowath Quay. Glad I came. Temple is well maintained and has some interesting objects, especially the huge mandala. I also liked the bull and elephant statues. Tuk tuk touts out front are annoying.",
          "If you like temples, this is one of the better choices. I personally got a tuk-tuk for the day and visited several temples around Phnom Phen.",
          "We dropped into see Wat Ounalom as it\u2019s located basically very close to the Royal Palace which we had just visited. It\u2019s the headquarters for Cambodian Buddhism. It\u2019s here that the top monk resides. In its earlier days it was used as a library for the Buddhist institute.",
          "Not much to say really. This is just a temple where people can pray. It is free and very pretty. A lot of statues of Buddah and Monks are around too. Nice place to go if you just want to take in some culture.",
          "We visited here on our way to the Royal Palace which is just a few minutes away. Not a great deal to say about it. iThere is a hindu statue and has a classroom for students. It is very nice and worth a visit as you're in the area.",
          "A bit of fun, our group were blessed by a monk so sat on the floor and had water sprayed all over us, got a red wool plated bracelet to help with our blessing, gave a donation for the experience. We enjoyed it.",
          "tuk tuk or walk here and you'll get to walk up the highest hill in Phnom Penh! - although don't expect a mountain! There are more than one temple of differing religions at the top",
          "Walked around complex. It\u2019s well worth a visit to check it out. It\u2019s free of charge and very near the Royal Palace.",
          "Wat Ounalom and the Royal Palace are both close by. Seeing the local sites, either on foot or via tuk-tuk is an easy one day orientation to anyone visiting Phnom Penh for the first time. If you've got the stamina, you might also consider venturing to the Genocide War Museum.",
          "My family and I made a quick stop here after visiting the Royal Palace, which is just a stone's throw away. In all honesty, we didn't really get to explore much of this temple, as it had started to rain heavily not long after we arrived, and the temple was about to close for the",
          "You cannot avoid this Wat. Along the Riverside. But there are many fake monks as well as real monks on the take operating in Cambodia. Government has come down hard on them. Remember, you should never have to pay a monk for anything. Also, respect that many poor people live",
          "A nice wat to see if you never saw one. They look great until you see a bunch of them, then all start to look the same. hahah",
          "Founded in 1443 AD, Wat Ounalom is the center of Cambodian Buddhism. Located on Sisoulath Quay, near the Royal Palace of Cambodia, the monument Buddhist compound features elaborate stupas and a monastry.",
          "Wat Ounalom is located at Sotherearos Blvd, just across the street from Sisowath Quay and close to the Royal Palace. It is beautiful and well worth a visit.",
          "This temple located not far from National Museum. Just a short walk u can get to this temple. Its a small temple with golden color. Worth visit if u visit Royal Palace and National Museum which just nearby.",
          "We chanced upon this temple while walking down the Sisowath Quay. Impressive facade. Interesting to find out that it was built in 1943 and is the headquarters and home of the Buddhist order in Cambodia. Stupa with beautiful detail is worth noting.",
          "It is located in the center of Phnom Penh. 15 minutes walk from the Royal Palace and just about 3-5 minutes from the National Museum. The atmosphere there is peaceful and quiet. Some places do not allow visitors to enter.",
          "While it wasn't a top spot to see if you don't have much time in PP, there were some fun photographic opportunities with lots of cats lounging around, and statues to make it interesting. This was our second time in PP, so it was a perfect stop for us.",
          "I was expected too much. But it was not bad, but just not as I thought. The place was under renovation. Nothing really to see.",
          "Nice temple in Phnom Penh, but not exquisit. The rest of the area is worth to explore and take pictures.",
          "You can visit the temples in this complex but be mindful that there are monks that lives here as well. This is one of the holiest and quieter places in Phnom Penh.",
          "Evening time ,was having a stroll on the river front when I saw this monastery . Walked in . Nice place but the main temple is a bit congested with multiple statues of Buddha . Peaceful and tranquil",
          "Arrived during lunch and was not able to enter to give my prayers. Lunchtime is between 1-2pm. however the architecture is simply exquisite",
          "Entrance is free to this Pagoda and it\u2019s not streaming with tourists. It is nice to see and there were a few monks around as well. The gold statues were really cool too.",
          "A good place just to walk around in..beautiful place where one is able to stay as long as desired and no one takes notice of you.. (No entrance fee)",
          "This temple is not too far away from the quay and the Royal Palace so the three og them can be seen in one walking tour. It\u2019s nothing special, though, if you have seen other temples. Just another one in my book.",
          "Visited this temple whilst in Phnom Penh. For me it's not a wow factor temple like others I've seen. I would not go back to visit this temple but that's my opinion. Go if you like temples if you've seen amazing ones then you could miss this one out.",
          "It is another of Phnom Penh\u2019s five original monasteries. It is one of the most significant pagodas featuring the headquarters of Cambodian Buddhism. In the earlier years, this pagoda served as the library of the Buddhist Institute. At that time, this place has cumulated a",
          "Its advised as a landmark or tourist place but actually is just a temple. Important for the locals and buddhists coming in but nothing significant in terms of tourists.",
          "Was not busy when I visited, big area of small temples inside, worth a visit and a interesting place, good structure of temples",
          "We walked by and we went in. There was just 1 other tourist. The young monk told us to go upstairs so see more of the city and the temple.",
          "This was my favorite temple in PP. It has a large complex with monks and very interesting statues. It is right in front of the river.",
          "This is a large Complex just beside the river. There is a lot of work going on just now. The main hall is large but quite empty really. There are a number of large stupas in the grounds and a great laughing Buddha statue. To be honest I have seen better Wats -still it is worth",
          "I stayed near to Wat Ounalom whilst in Phnom Penh, walked through it several times, and found it better each time, with a fabulous atmosphere in the middle of the hustle and bustle. Inside, there is plenty to walk around and just see, with many monks and daily life going on. I",
          "Best experience was going in to the inner temple (they locked up a door), and we climbed in to this neon lighted buddha - and got blessed. Kids liked it! We though it was fine. Dont need a lot of time, but worthwhile going into.",
          "A Buddhist temple compound, still functioning as a monastery. Feel free to walk around, take lots of photos, could be done in about 1 hour. No charge, but you could leave money at various locations near the statues.",
          "Visited this Wat after our trip to the national museum, as it was nearby. Climbing the stairs to the interior, as we got closer, for some reason there was just the aura of peace and serenity that seemed to develop. We were the only ones inside except for the monk, who kindly",
          "I like visiting this Wat when there is a festival on, or Khmer New Year especially, very vibrant atmosphere during festivals.",
          "This temple complex is one of the landmarks of downtown Phnom Penh. There's some renovation work taking place on one of the buildings but the others are intact and you can wander around inside freely. Don't believe the taxi touts who tell you it's closed and that you should take",
          "just one of the many pagodas. well place. calm and cool. not many visitors. only for religious minded persons.",
          "Another fine example of Cambodian architecture and very beautiful monument. Add this to your photo shoots.",
          "So full of life. Amazing active buddhist monastery. We were there during the 15-day Phjum Ben Ceremony, in which Cambodians return to their hometowns to their local Wats to honor their ancestors.",
          "this wat, Pagode, has been deeply damaged during the war. It is nowadays a lively place and temple, with view on the tonal sap, but not the most beautiful way you could see. It is interesting however because it is daily used by locals.",
          "Massive temple complex among the most important wats in Phnom Penh. Architecturally stunning with loads of intricate details & religious significance (Buddhist). Very close to the Palace, National Museum, etc. Put this on your must-see list. It is a temple complex & appropriate",
          "Well my visit here was quite awkward really. Read a couple of reviews on here about it being really nice so I visited it and to be honest, it was nothing great. Maybe I've seen way too many monasteries, temples and pagodas that are far more impressive but I didn't get much from",
          "Such a lovely place. I go in and sit in front of one of the main alters and do Spiritual practices. It is quiet and not overrun with tourists, a beautiful temple on the riverside. Going there is truly one of my fondest memories of Cambodia.",
          "Just a short visit and its a pleasant place. Calm and serene! Would recommend to come over in evening, as you can walk on the surrounding and its very near to national museum of Cambodia! Remember to drink lots of water!",
          "The importance of Wat Ounalom is in the fact that it is the headquarters of Cambodian Buddhism It is a large complex , lovingly cared for, which has stood the test of time. The people are friendly and helpful as also welcoming. The statues prayer flags, different altars are all",
          "Walk passed here everyday. Peaceful place. The temple is also beautiful. There some shade to cover from the sun. So no complaint there.",
          "This place is quite central and easy to find on the promenade. I believe is a very important wat to Phnom Penh, being the centre of Cambodian Buddhism. There are some nice statutes around the place although it was lunchtime when we went so the exhibition being held there was",
          "In the heart of the Riverside area this is a beautiful pagoda with a number of Buddha images. A peaceful oasis in the manic Riverside area, worth a visit as this is one of the most important Buddha places in PP.",
          "We came across this temple complex randomely and were so glad to find it! There are many houses within the complex itself, which gives a feeling that it can be a very busy place, however, at that time, the \"streets\" were quiet. Teenagers were playing football in front of the",
          "Very important for Cambodian Buddhism. The structure is quite big. After being almost abandoned during Pol Pot time now it is again very crowded.",
          "A big working temple (in fact, the centre of Buddhism in Cambodia) with a monastery, in the middle of the city, five minutes away from the National Museum. Much more impressive than Wat Phnom (and it's free and easy to get in), its stupa is said to contain an eyebrow hair of the",
          "It was a pleasant temple with plenty of bright colours and statues to decorate the place. The monks are peacefully going about their business. It costs nothing to visit and is right next to a heap of the other main attractions and is worth popping your head in to check it out.",
          "Wat Ounanlom has been around since 1422 and is one of the city's original 5 pagodas, situated a little north of the National Museum, facing the river. I visited the complex at 7 am when nobody was around and enjoyed the cooler weather. the country's top monk resides here and the",

          "A very picturesque Wat very near the Royal Palace. Yes it has recently been painted but that doesn't detract from popping in for a look.",
          "This is wonderful place to escape the city hustle and bustle. Beautiful architecture and one can observe monks go about their daily lives. It's beside the national museum and Royal Palace - so drop by -it's free.",

          "This temple on the Tonle Sap has a number of buildings, but is not of particular note, in my opinion. Someone wrote that they saw people working on the carvings. We saw men installing metal fixtures. If you are walking along the river, stop here, but in my opinion it is not",

          "Nice little temple. Quieter than others and very beautiful. Greeted by a large gold buddha and silver elephants. I enjoyed this one very much. Located close to royal palace",
          "Worth a visit if you are interested In Cambodian culture and religion ! Center of Cambodian Buddhism. No entrance fee",
          "By no means the prettiest Wats but it has a character and it seems more genuine as you see more monks living here and they are very friendly and nice to talk to.",
          "Centrally located next to Riverside Phnom Penh. But the recent renovation works, especially the use of the red color, looks highly unprofessional.",
          "You can't see every temple in Phnom Penh but do visit this one. Very different architecture and lots of monks busy in their activities Highly recommended",
          "I liked this Wat very much ... nothing super impressive but i went there in the mid day and it was calm and peaceful and I walked all around felt like a real 'kampung\" style in the alley in the back... but what i liked the most was it was QUIET .. the sound of nothing.. was",
          "I liked this visit, there was a ceremony going on, many monksfield, nuns and photographers present, so not the usual peaceful temple visit It's free to enter and walking distance to other sites so easy to include in trip",
          "I spend a few minutes here before going to the independent monument. It is a very classic Wat with many locals. Definitely worth to visit.",
          "This place, Wat Ounalom, is one of the finest Wats to visit in this area of Cambodia. It is also where the holiest Buddhist Monk resides in Cambodia. He happened to be there when I paid my visit. He blessed all of my group that was there. This is a once in a life time",
          "We went to visit one morning, there was no people and we enjoyed to visit a quiet place of prayer. You have to visit it!!!",
          "Yet another Wat. We have seen enough now to last a lifetime. Buddha was in his humble glory, very serene indeed",
          "Worth visiting when coming to river front to enjoy the evening walk. A few ancient stupa at the back of temple, don't miss it.",

          "I've been to numerous wats in Thailand and Cambodia and while this one is quite nice it just doesn't stand out compared to other wats in other cities/countries. If this is your first time in Cambodia/Southeast Asia, definitely stop in as it very lovely but if this is your 50th",

          "Went inside and found it interesting with so many statues of Buddhas and Buddhist Monks. Just a short walk from my hotel along the water front.",
          "It is not a must, but it is a beautiful building. Pass along if you visit the national museum, it's close by. When we were there it was decorated with coloured flags. Nice peaceful place.",
          "In my opinion its just another Wat pagoda, nothing special about this place and when i visited it look kinda empty. You can visit if you are already near but don't waste time to coming specially for that.",
          "I was horrified to find out that they have animal sacrifices here. They also do the so-called life release here as they do in many Buddhist temples. If not for these two details, this place would be wonderful.",
          "There is something about this \"oldest temple\" in Phnom Penh: storing one of the relics of Buddha Shakyamuni, monk blessing visitors, new buildings and the old (presumably original) sections, and the wide compound. Many have missed the small stupas behind the big tall building,",
          "We really enjoyed visiting Wat Ounalom, the site of Buddha's eyebrow. There weren't many tourists and we were able to enjoy the religious site in peaceful quietude. There were friendly monks who were happy to explain the significance of the temple and say a prayer with us.",

          "Despite the tuk tuk drivers outside telling us \"twenty minutes open\" nearly an hour before we visited this temple properly, bizarrely at about 14:30, the main hall of this temple was still closed. Ignore the drivers at the main entrance, as they merely want you to buy their",

          "it is a series of temples near the royal palace/national museum. You can wander around the complex and see inside some of them for free. If your lucky you can see some of the monks go about their daily rituals.",
          "I stayed not far from it and went there daily for meditation, I meet a old monk who didn't speak English but he took me to the privite wat out back and gave me a blessing. Every humbling",
          "Super nice temples and immediate grounds. You can tell the complex has been there for many years. If you're lucky, you'll see the lines of monks going into the temples to pray. There's something different about this place. It somehow has something a little magical about it.",
          "do walk up and around for a peaceful wat in the heart of the city. simple and nice and houses some great snapshots of religion.",
          "Easy to find just by the Royal Palace compound. It is said to be dedicated as a repository for the remnants of some rich characters and financed by Mr. Hun Sen, present Prime Minister.",
          "After a week in Phnom Penh I must admit I walked past Wat Ounalom many times as I thought I had seen enough temples over my 4 week visit in Cambodia. I was on a Vespa tour when my guide was showing me around the Temple and said it's worth a look inside. I'm so glad we did they",
          "We stopped by on our way back to the hotel. We went inside and were greeted by a friendly old man who showed us inside one of the smaller temples in the back. Unique experience!",
          "If your on the river side, its worth giving this pagoda a quick look see. It's had a lot of work done to it over the past two years.",
          "Unlike most temple sites, this one is not crowded. But it is on the quay, and is quite pretty. It is also near the palace compound, so it is fairly close to where you are likely to be. Worth a stop.",
          "have a look if you are passing but do not bother seeking it out as nothing too impressive but central so one may be in the area",
          "This was the first Wat we visited in south east Asia, and it definitely set the bar high! Honestly I would say if you done have much time, see this one instead of Wat Phnom. Wat Ounalom is MUCH less crowded, and we weren't asked for money once (unlike the children at Wat Phnom,",
          "What a pleasant and awe inspiring surprise the painting on the inside of the Wat are! Wonderful place to visit. The grounds are another example of the relief that can be found in the heart of Phnom Penh from the traffic.",
          "This Wat has the most beautiful architecture and colors. When I visited, there was a Buddist class going on with lots of people taking notes. To me this is a must visit and its close to riverside and the palace. The Cambodian monks are very friendly and will in some cases",
          "It is one of the free wats that my tuktuk driver and I visited on 2.26.2016. We said our prayers, admired the beauty of our surroundings, and took lots of pictures. Saw more buildings toward the back of this attraction, appeared to be occupied and used by monks.",
          "We officially started our Phnom Penh tour with this place. The building roof is so beautiful and the interiors look serene. This is for free.",
          "The title says it all reqally. When we visited, there was a large group of (female) pilgrims who were so friendly and kept offering us cakes and bottles of water. A ceremony complete with monks and chanting was also held. I suppose you could be unlucky and not get the ceremony,",
          "A definite temple and pagoda to visit We were fortunate enough when visiting the pogaga inside to get a special blessing from the \" Eye brow Budda \" which was an amazing experience A definite place if you have time",
          "I was very excited for this as I was told by a local that it was authentic & that if I wanted to see monks in action this would be the place. On my arrival I found it to be dirty, uninspiring, unfriendly and the tour guides cheapened the whole experience. They close the main",

          "Close to such attractions as the royal palace and national museum, Wat Ounalom can be easily overlooked. But it is well worth a visit. A center of Cambodian Buddhism, it has a history of several hundred years. Damaged by the Khmer rouge, it has been beautifully restored. Not",
          "This is a wonderful Wat, located just off the Riverside area. A wander through the grounds and the monks quarters is a welcome respite from the noise and traffic of the rest of the city.",
          "Very nice architecture though I would recommend only going if you're nearby. Not really worth its own trip. The tuk tuk drivers out front were particularly pesky; with multiple polite no's and no thank yous before they would stop pestering me with there details of tours.",
          "A visit to Wat Ounalom allows insight into the spiritual teachings, philosophies and history of Buddhism in Cambodia. Perhaps the most prominent and oldest of five pagodas in the country, Wat Ounalom is the centre of Cambodian Buddhism and serves as the abode of the Patriarch of",

          "More to do in Phnom Penh are nothing much, but if you wandered you will always find something to do. The Sisowath Quay is one of the place in Phnom Penh where I love to stroll. Along this way to find the most stunning sights in Phnom Penh, the Royal Palace and this Temple are",
          "After you have finished at the Royal Palace, continue along the waterfront and pop Ito Wat Ounalum. It has been refurbished quite a few times over the years so it can feel a little 'bling bling', but it has a genuine community of worshippers and monks.",
          "We didn't intend to visit this temple, but came across it on our way to the royal palace, it looked so beautiful from outside that we had to go in. The buildings are just beautiful, thousands of buddhist and cambodian flags flapping in all directions, beautifuly adorned bells",

          "It was evident that Wat Ounalom has gone through renovations many times. The area is well-maintained and tiles look new. It is one of the better maintained temples in Cambodia. However, it is precisely this reason that makes this temple bland. If I have not heard anything about",
          "Obviously one of the most important buddhist temples in Cambodia, it's a nice respite from the crazy traffic all around. The Khmer Rouge must have done a lot of damage to it.",
          "Open and quiet Wat within a working monastry compound. The buildings are stately though not as overtly grandious. It is right next to the waterfront, so worth incorporating in your walk along the riverside.",
          "This is a nice temple and also the real temple as you can enjoy peaceful, quiet and pleasant walk within the temple. It is a must as you can spend less than an houe to take photo or talk with the monks id there is any.",
          "This place is definitely in a better shape than most temples in the Cambodian capital. Its cleanliness and organization definitely measure up to the beauty of the statues and buildings found there. Don`t miss it!",
          "Strolling the grounds is interesting to see a variety of the Buddhist temple buildings. One is a shrine that has an eyebrow hair of Buddha. In front of this small temple are some historic statues and a memorial to a Japanese reporter killed in the Vietnam war era. Best to go in",
          "This is a big but empty pagoda. There was a monk sitting at the front in discussion with a group of men but other than that there was very little to see. You don't need to spend more than 10 minutes here.",

          "Wat Ounalom is quiet and peaceful place, you can enjoy the cambodian architecture and difernts styles of statues, great gardens.",
          "This place is walkable from Sisowath Quay. The building was really pretty and the ambience was of an actual temple - not the touristy ones. Lots of statues in the area. I love it!",

          "I arrived very early in the morning and was greeted by a grey haired old man who opened early for me. Then I was blessed and walked out feeling very special\u2026 Then an amazing thing happened. There was the sweetest tuk tuk driver who took me on a super adventure. I wanted to go",

          "Wat Ounalom is yet another pagoda to visit in Phnom Penh. It is a peaceful and medium sized pagoda and free to visited. Worth visiting if you like buddhist architecture and pagodas and less touristy then the silver pagoda.",
          "Its for free!! this place is way too cute i took a lot of pictures outside, so what happened we didn't know that it closes around 1pm. ( take note of that!!) so we wasn't able to get inside the palace/pagoda. so even if we were not able to get inside we enjoy the place",
          "It's worth a visit. There is no entrance fees. Inside it is a very quiet place where you can just get around and take photos.",
          "It was very peaceful to wander around within the grounds. There were roosters wandering with us! Beautiful buildings and landscaping. Doesn't take long to see it, but a nice stop on the way to or from the palace. Very pretty and also free!",

          "There are two main temple buildings with steps to get up to their entrances, but the one on the right (as facing the temple) with cow statues at the bottom of the steps had its door closed when I was there. So I only went up the one on the left which was pretty ordinary inside,",
          "Nice pagoda. But if you have seen any Buddhist temple don't waste your time. A couple of buildings with Buddha statues inside. Nothing special to see.",
          "We went on the day of new year as it was our last day here. Here there was a small get together just for locals. The temple isn't amazing itself and rather small. Everyone was staring at us and made us feel not welcome at all. Enjoy!",
          "A large Wat in the town centre. We wondered through as a short cut from our hotel towards the centre and found it enchanting. It is a working, worshiping and living area for the monks who you'll meet there. There are temples and stupas and things going on. There is no",
          "Small, quiet, worth a visit. We accidentally entered the Wat from the backdoor, but no one really said anything. We saw a small shrine where an old man beckoned to us. He gave us a blessing and was surprised when we donated a small amount. It was a cool experience. The Wat",

          "Unlike Wat Phnom this temple you can wander around and really appreciate it as it is so peaceful and quiet. The temple and icons surrounding it are a lot more interesting than Wat Phnom too. A lot of people miss out on this but I think it is definitely worth a short visit.",

          "As with a lot of Wats, the exterior is very impressive. However going into the pagoda shows it is either new or a lack of attention as it doesn't replicate the outside. We may have missed something that others didn't but certainly didn't have the splendour of any temples we had",
          "It's a very peaceful stop with plenty of opportunities for interesting photos. A security gentleman at the gate seemed truly interested in meeting people and welcoming them.",
          "I can't say much, you've got to experience it. It has retained its authenticity. Try to go there on a Saturday or Sunday when there is service. And yes, it is important to tip, even there, especially there. You might experience something that will stay with you forever. I wish",

          "Situated close by the riverfront and Royal Palace, this is well worth a visit. Great views from the pagoda. Five different golden Buddhas line up at the front for offerings. I was blessed by a monk in one of the smaller temples in the complex. 350 monks live here.",
          "Nice temple not far from Royal Palace, worth popping in for a few photos if you're nearby. Not really worth a special trip unless you're a big temple freak -- the Royal Palace offers much more. Evidently they have some free public performances at set times, which I missed.",

          "I'm pretty sure this temple is the headquarters for Buddhism in Cambodia but as a temple there's nothing special about it at all, in fact a lot of the 'normal' temples around Cambodia which are in active use are far better to look at and go around. Even when you go to the top of",
          "Compared to Wat Phnom this is a lovely little temple right on the riverside. It seems to be less popular so it was a great place to come and meditate and get away from the busy transactions of the day and city. I cam here a few times over my stay and found it very calming",

          "We did the behind the scenes tour here. This is definitely the way to see this place - it is an hour and a half from Phnom Penh and if you just arrived and paid the ordinary entrance fee you would not: - interact with elephants. - see the keepers changing an elephant\u2019s",
          "We went on a small group trip with Wildlife Alliance. At $150 p/p it's on the pricey side but 100% of the profits go towards the charity and the whole experience was so amazing that it was totally worth it. From taking Lucky the elephant for a walk to visiting the baby animals",

          "Firstly lets make it clear, this is not a zoo, it's a rescue centre. A little bit confusing as to who supplies the food to feed the animals, you will be swamped by locals but it is cheap and the enjoyment you get from feeding the animals is lovely. There is so very much to see",
          "I did a lot of research on parks to visit in South East Asia and was happy when I found this one here in Cambodia. I have read a lot of reviews on here, especially the bad ones which point out negatives in the form of not seeing many animals. The whole point of this place is",

          "Very reasonable to get in but it is about an hour and a half drive from Phnom Penh. Also great to see Cambodia taking animal welfare seriously . A great tip is speak to the coconut sellers and as long as you buy a couple of coconuts they act as unofficial tour guides. Well worth",
          "Let me start by saying that you should not just \"show up\". Do yourself a favor, don't be cheap and book a tour. You will be taken to meet the animals behind the scenes and learn each one's story. Remember this is a rescue center, and many of the stories are tragic. Most animals",
          "This place is a balance of amazing people trying to help rehabilitate wildlife who have ended up there from loss of habitat, surrendered pets (pets....) or animal cruelty and a balance of sadness that this can happen. The people working here, I believe do such a fabulous job",

          "Probably the one and only oldest zoo, I could remember. Great place tov enjoy on weekend. Be aware of weather though as the zoo don't have roofing. It about 42km away from phnompenh. So if can rent a moto for a fun ride along national road #2(if you dare to ride in the traffic).",

          "A good place to visit to see some of Cambodia's wildlife. It's a large area but that's not a problem as your Tuk Tuk can take you from place to place. Not all of it is in use and up to date like a western zoo, If your expecting that. But there is a wide variety of animal's to",

          "Heading back from Chisor when did a hard right and headed along a straight road sadly lined with many beggers. The zoo was very large and held many animals, some but all not all of the enclosures had no information as to which animal we were looking at :). At the first stop",
          "Go with a guide. Otherwise you'll just think it's a crappy zoo. Animals are fairly well kept and keep in mind that the animals they have there are just the ones who lived in captivity so long they can't be reintroduced. So don't expect fancy young animals but maybe older sweeter",
          "Like many Zoos in 3rd world countries this zoo does not have enclosures of the same standard as many found in western and developed countries, however I do believe the centre is extremely good if you keep in mind that these animals are rescued animals whom if left in the wild",

          "The experience was a very memorable one as we didn't quite know if we were inside the park at first. A few local kids sold us fruit and vegetables for the animals, then guided us to an unmarked gate which we later found out was the entrance. The are quite a lot of animals in",
          "Quite a lot of wildlife and selection of birds. Nice setting too. We were encouraged to feed the elephants and it was fun. The kids loved it all.",
          "many birds, animals, and wonderful jungle that you can relax and take some food also can ride the big bike.",
          "We loved this place. Weren't sure what it would be like but as Asian zoo's go it was brilliant. Lots of room for the animals, much larger than I anticipated. Lots of rare animals and a wide variety of different species. All the animals have been confiscated from illegal pet",
          "We came here with Betelnut Tours as it is at least an hour outside of the city, more in traffic and there is limited signage too so it was better to have someone tell us the stories of the animals they have rescued. They also told us which animals you could touch which is great",
          "I am actually really sad I contributed to this business. I normally don't go to zoos as I feel it's not fair having animals in cages, especially not small ones. However, going to a \"rescue\" center felt like the opposite, like I could contribute. This was not the case though.",
          "It is about 40 kilometer distance from Phnom Penh. We should visiting Phnom Tamao by Tuk Tuk or Rent Motor cycle. It has many type of animal, birth in there.",
          "I was hesitant due to the price, but if you're from the states 85% of the cost is tax-deductible, which was a nice surprise. The exclusive Wildlife Alliance tour is absolutely worth every penny. You get up close with many of the animals, and you get to feed baby monkeys and let",
          "We were slightly dubious about the price for the tour, but it is worth every dollar! The money goes back into the centre and the amazing conservation and rehabilitation work they carry out. I will be making regular donations when I get home! We were picked up by Nicky and Mr Vut",
          "We have been with visiting family and also taken our NGO there several times. It definitely does not compare to a Western zoo as it is all custom seized animals, but it is great to join a Free the Bears tour to see all the great work behind the scenes and what is being done in",
          "We booked this tour last minute as my husband was tying to make up an elephant tour we missed in Chiang Mai. At first I wasn't sure what the tour was going to be like. We booked directly with Wildlife Alliance, which is what I recommend doing, they take you to \"VIP\" places you",
          "My daughter and I care deeply about animals so we decided to make Wildlife Alliance a part of our trip to Phnom Penh, and we certainly are glad we did. Transport to and from the center, as well as lunch, is included in the price of the tour. We got to interact with and feed a",
          "First of all, we did not go with a guided tour. We took a tuk-tuk from riverside and payed avout 30 dollars (abit expensive and we did not bargain much). Be aware of the last bit of road leading up to the zoo is covered by poor people begging for food or money. We really",
          "We visited Phnom Tamao by doing the tour directly through the Wildlife Alliance, which was definitely the way to go. It's expensive, but all the money goes towards the center and the animals and is worth every penny--our guides were so knowledgeable and we learned a lot (price",
          "This centre does it's very best to rehabilitate and help animals that were rescued. The one thing that stood out to us from the visit was how much the staff here truly care about animals. This park is not a lush, beautiful and well-groomed site - it IS huge, quiet and provides",
          "I was a little unsure about visiting this park due to some of the reviews, I consider myself an animal love and try not to support anything I consider inhuman and cruel this park was none of these things. We splurge on the wildlife behind the scenes tour and it was well worth",
          "Having read about this place prior to going to Cambodia I was tempted to just pay the admission fee of 5 bucks and tour on my own. I initially thougt the Tamao Wildlife Tour was pricey until we went. ..and realized it was money well spent. The animals are well cared for with 4",

          "I did a separate review of the day tour offered, but I wanted to post here as well. This centre is well worth the visit, but I do think it should be done as a tour and not on your own. The sanctuary is very large, and as it's primary goat is not that of a zoo, it could be",
          "We had a great day here loved every bit of it well worth going too. The tour was good with lots of information. You got to feed bananas to the animals, lots of them just walked up to you",
          "We hire a private taxi to take us the Phnom Tamao Rescue Center. Entrance to the center is very reasonable however costs getting there did not make the trip worth it. The center could benefit by adding more information in English about the animals. Often there was only one",
          "Awesome experience! We had booked the behind-the-scenes tour and it was such an amazing and well organized day! Thank you very much to Nikki and Emma, who were explaining the animals and it's sometimes very shocking stories. The rescue center is only run by donations and it's",

          "So glad we did this tour of the rescue centre with Wildlife Alliance! Firstly, the cost ($150 USD) goes to a great cause - helping wildlife alliance rehabilitate and continue to rescue animals in need, and if this isn't enough of a reason it is also tax deductable (for",
          "This was an awful sight to see. Leading into the park there are countless beggars then once at the park the cages are small, overgrown with weeds, or just baron dirt floors. Upon entry you are mobbed by people trying to get you to buy bananas. The park is hard to find your way",
          "We arranged a tour and got picked up at a local garage and took out to the rescue centre in a mini bus, what a great day myself and my 12 year old daughter had, we love animals and loved spending the day at the centre we both learned so much about all the animals. 2 tour guides",
          "Getting to take Lucky the elephant for a walk, seeing how a prosthetic leg is fitted to another elephant whose leg was amputated after stepping in a trap, feeding elephants, seeing tigers, leopards, otters, up close, caressing a gibbon, entering the macaques cage...is just a bit",
          "We paid the extra money for the behind the scenes tour. Yes, it was expensive, but was well worth it and the money goes to a good cause. If you have any concerns about animals in their care, just ask, and they will tell you the animal's story!",
          "We did the Behind The Scenes Tour. Emma and Nikki were great guides. You couldn't meet two nicer girls/ladies. We thoroughly enjoyed our day seeing/meeting the animals rescued and hearing their stories. Both guides were knowledgeable, interesting and clearly had a strong feel",

          "My husband and I did the behind the scenes experience here and it was worth every penny. The center is doing great things for the many animals that they have rescued from horrible experiences. The stories of the animals are heartbreaking. We were picked up by our guide Adrian",
          "We visited PTWRC through wildlife alliance and were treated to a behind the scenes tour of the facility.....Yes it costs more to do it this way....but its for a good cause. All animals have been rescued from illegal animal trades or from dangerous situations. The park works in",
          "It was ok. We just felt sorry for the animals, behind those not so great cages. the road there wasn't so great , so I would suggest taking a Taxi, and not a Tuk Tuk, as so many will try to offer it to you, for cheap. if you go by Taxi it will set you back about $30.00",
          "The animals are not in good condition , except , perhaps , bears , who do have a decent space . The tiger is in a pathetic condition. Elephants offer shows to the public. I think it is not necessary to say anything more . Do not go .",
          "We did our trip through Wildlife Alliance. I can't say enough good things about them! We got to see and interact with many different animals. It's obvious that the staff really cares about all the animals. We got to hear the stories of the animals as well. Elephant & monkey",
          "It is pretty evident that they don't feed the animals properly so you will buy their food and feed it to them. I also question the safety. Located rather far from Phnom Penh.",
          "It took two hours to get to this wildlife rescue center. The best part of the attraction was the interaction you get with the monkeys. Other than the Monkeys, all the animals are kept in very small enclosures. If you are used to American zoos skip this visit.",
          "We visited in May 2015 with the Behind the Scenes Tour with the Wildlife Alliance. Although pricey, the experience was worth every penny and it was heartening to know that the money is put toward the care of the animals. Our tour guide was phenomenal - she was knowledgeable",
          "Phnom Tamao Wilflide Rescue Centre is a worthwhile day trip from Phnom Penh to see wildlife and have lunch. $5 USD entry for tourists. The animals seem to be well taken care of although some animals that were housed alone seemed a bit depressed. Make sure you stop at the deer",
          "This place is obviously doing great work in saving the moon bears and helping the mine affected elephants. These animals also have nice enclosures. They should just keep to that. The rest of the place is like a poorly run zoo. The animals are in small cages and seem to be there",

          "We were well looked after by our guide Phoa. There were no jeeps and our group was 9 people. But the animals are gorgeous and the elephant is everyone's favourite. Our guide went above and beyond and we got to go behind the scenes a few time. The lunch is delicious!",
          "My husband and I had an amazing tour with the Wildlife Alliance. We were picked up at a central gas station and taken by car to the Rescue Center, stopping along the way to buy fruit for the Animals. Our guides, Niki and Emma, were really friendly and told us a lot about the",

          "I loved this place! They are doing great work and clearly care about the animals. This tour is a fundraising effort so you interact with some of the animals. It was very educational and fun. The priority always was the animals and not tourists. We greatly enjoyed it! I would",

          "I have been here twice and have enjoyed both the trip there by tuk tuk (although long) and the experience of visiting an active animal sanctuary. We took our one year old grand-daughter to visit also. We were met by a small troupe of children selling bananas and root vegetables",

          "We had a wonderful day! A highlight for me was spending so much time with the beautiful elephants & hearing their stories. But we also had the chance to behind the scenes with many other animals. A Beautiful Cambodian lunch was included. The animals here are so lucky to have",
          "I would like to start off by saying what a fabulous job Wildlife Alliance & the staff at PTWRC are doing. This is by far the best rescue centre I have been to- the animals are treated well and enclosures are an adequate size. One point I should make is this is a 'rescue centre'",
          "Well, Let me start off by saying the Australian lady we had today as a guide was great and as was Chum the Cambodian assistant. Very polite and talkative all day. And it was great to see animals which would otherwise be dead living seemingly happy enough lives, although in",
          "I uded to work in a wildlife rehabilitation centre, a serious one, and THERE IS NO WAY TOURISTS ARE ALLOWED TO BE IN CONTACT OR FEED THE ANIMALS, if they wanna have a single chance to be released and survive in the wild. A tiger in a cage forever is not happy. Would you rather",
          "The animal park is spacious. You walk between the monkeys and deer by. It also included many pens of the animals (in wooded area). At the entrance you will be overwhelmed by the locals to buy food for the animals. The part where the bears are captured is new and much nicer than",
          "There are so many wonderful animals at Phnom Tamao and your entrance fee helps keep the animals safe. The Tigers in particular are worth a FORTUNE on the black market, so they need to be heavily guarded against poachers. One word of caution... if you have long blond hair...",

          "The majority of this park is on the right track and the animals are well looked after. That said some cages are far too small, dirty and in need of repair. The crocodiles and birds in particular look in need of some attention. Also the amount of rubbish is hard to understand and",
          "Two Cambodian friends and I went to the wildlife center by tuk-tuk, and the ride took us about an hour from Phnom Penh. This is an area of protected forest and was well-shaded and fairly cool on a hot day. We saw many birds, monkeys, several sun bears, one tiger, a few",

          "This place has all the potential of the world since they have a big diversity of rescued animals. Unfortunately most of this animals are craving for food and they get fed by visitors all the time (very bad. At the sunbear's cage it is clearly explained not to feed the bears",

          "I highly recommend the \"VIP\" Behind the Scenes tour. Emma was fabulous and the work they do is exceptional. Sadly, I cannot recommend it as a \"zoo\" visit, at least for us spoiled Americans, as the circumstance for the animals is grim relative to what we expect at the glitzy zoos",
          "Yes, Cambodia has exciting places to visit, but while traveling it's nice to take a \"kindness break\" now and then, and recharge your mental batteries (which can get run down with all the stimulation). Phnom Tamao was one of those places for me. I would suggest the Wildlife",

        "wiki": "A wat (Khmer: \u179c\u178f\u17d2\u178f w\u014dat; Lao: \u0ea7\u0eb1\u0e94 vat; Thai: \u0e27\u0e31\u0e14,RTGS: wat,pronounced [w\u00e1t]; Tai L\u00fc: \u300c\u1a45\u1a2f\u1a60\u1a30\u300d\uff08waD+Dha\uff09; Northern Thai: \u300c\u1a45\u1a60\u1a2f\u1a76\u300d\uff08w+Da2\uff09) is a type of Buddhist temple and Hindu temple in Cambodia, Laos, East Shan State, Yunnan and Thailand. The word wat is a thai word that was borrowed from Sanskrit v\u0101\u1e6da (Devan\u0101gar\u012b: \u0935\u093e\u091f), meaning 'enclosure'. The term has varying meanings in each region, sometimes referring to a specific type of government-recognised or large temple, other times referring to any Buddhist or Hindu temple.\n\n\n== Overview ==\n\nStrictly speaking, a wat is a Buddhist sacred precinct with vihara (quarters for bhikkhus), a temple, an edifice housing a large image of Buddha and a facility for lessons. A site without a minimum of three resident bhikkhus cannot correctly be described as a wat although the term is frequently used more loosely, even for ruins of ancient temples. As a transitive or intransitive verb, wat means to measure, to take measurements; compare templum, from which temple derives, having the same root as template.\nIn Cambodia, a wat is any place of worship. \"Wat\" generally refers to a Buddhist place of worship, but the precise term is \u179c\u178f\u17d2\u178f\u1796\u17bb\u1791\u17d2\u1792\u179f\u17b6\u179f\u1793\u17b6 wat putthasasana.  A Christian church can be referred as \u179c\u17b7\u17a0\u17b6\u179a\u1799\u17c1\u179f\u17ca\u17bc vihear Yesaou or \"Jesus vihear\". Angkor Wat \u17a2\u1784\u17d2\u1782\u179a\u179c\u178f\u17d2\u178f means 'city of temples'.\nIn everyday language in Thailand, a \"wat\" is any place of worship except a mosque (Thai: \u0e2a\u0e38\u0e40\u0e2b\u0e23\u0e48\u0e32; RTGS: surao; or Thai: \u0e21\u0e31\u0e2a\u0e22\u0e34\u0e14; RTGS: matsayit) or a synagogue (Thai: \u0e2a\u0e38\u0e40\u0e2b\u0e23\u0e48\u0e32\u0e22\u0e34\u0e27; RTGS: surao yio). Thus, a wat chin (\u0e27\u0e31\u0e14\u0e08\u0e35\u0e19) or san chao (\u0e28\u0e32\u0e25\u0e40\u0e08\u0e49\u0e32) is a Chinese temple (either Buddhist or Taoist), wat khaek (\u0e27\u0e31\u0e14\u0e41\u0e02\u0e01) or thewasathan (\u0e40\u0e17\u0e27\u0e2a\u0e16\u0e32\u0e19) is a Hindu temple and bot khrit (\u0e42\u0e1a\u0e2a\u0e16\u0e4c\u0e04\u0e23\u0e34\u0e2a\u0e15\u0e4c) or wat farang (\u0e27\u0e31\u0e14\u0e1d\u0e23\u0e31\u0e48\u0e07) is a Christian church, though Thai \u0e42\u0e1a\u0e2a\u0e16\u0e4c (RTGS: bot) may be used descriptively as with mosques.\n\n\n== Types ==\n\nAccording to Thai law, there are two types of Thai Buddhist temples:\n\nWats (\u0e27\u0e31\u0e14; wat) are temples which have been endorsed by the state and have been granted wisungkhammasima (\u0e27\u0e34\u0e2a\u0e38\u0e07\u0e04\u0e32\u0e21\u0e2a\u0e35\u0e21\u0e32), or the land for establishing central hall, by the king. These temples are divided into:Royal temples (Thai: \u0e1e\u0e23\u0e30\u0e2d\u0e32\u0e23\u0e32\u0e21\u0e2b\u0e25\u0e27\u0e07; RTGS: phra aram luang ): established or patronised by the king or his family members.\nPublic temples (Thai: \u0e27\u0e31\u0e14\u0e23\u0e32\u0e29\u0e0e\u0e23\u0e4c; RTGS: wat rat ): established by private citizens. Despite the term \"private\", private temples are open to the public and are sites of public religious activities.\nSamnak song (Thai: \u0e2a\u0e33\u0e19\u0e31\u0e01\u0e2a\u0e07\u0e06\u0e4c): are temples without state endorsement and wisungkhamasima.\n\n\n== Structure ==\n\nA typical Buddhist wat consists of the following buildings:\n\nBell tower (Khmer: \u1794\u17c9\u1798\u1787\u17bd\u1784; Lao: \u0eab\u0ecd\u0ea5\u0eb0\u0e84\u0eb1\u0e87; Thai: \u0e2b\u0e2d\u0e23\u0e30\u0e06\u0e31\u0e07)\nBot (Thai: \u0e42\u0e1a\u0e2a\u0e16\u0e4c) or ubosot (Lao: \u0ead\u0eb8\u0ec2\u0e9b\u0eaa\u0ebb\u0e94; Thai: \u0e2d\u0e38\u0e42\u0e1a\u0e2a\u0e16; from Pali uposatha) or sim (Lao: \u0eaa\u0eb4\u0ea1): the holiest prayer room, also called the \"ordination hall\" as it is where new monks take their vows. Architecturally it is similar to the vihara. The main difference is the eight cornerstones placed around the bot to ward off evil. The bot is usually more decorated than the wihan. In Cambodia nowadays, this type of building is considered to be Vihear. It was previously called Ubaosathakea or Rorng Ubaosoth (Khmer: \u17a7\u1794\u17c4\u179f\u1790\u17b6\u1782\u17b6\u179a \u17ac \u179a\u17c4\u1784\u17a7\u1794\u17c4\u179f\u1790).\nChaedai (Khmer: \u1785\u17c1\u178f\u17b7\u1799) or Chedi (Thai: \u0e40\u0e08\u0e14\u0e35\u0e22\u0e4c; Lao: \u0ec0\u0e88\u0e94\u0eb5) from Sanskrit: chaitya, temple or that (Lao: \u0e97\u0eb2\u0e94): It is also known as a stupa. Usually conical or bell-shaped buildings, but many Cambodian stupas are constructed in the style of temple shrine. They often contain relics of Buddha. The urns containing the ashes of the cremated dead are kept here and serve as memorials for those ancestors.\nChantakhara (Thai: \u0e0a\u0e31\u0e19\u0e15\u0e32\u0e06\u0e23): a room in which fire and water are kept.\nDrum tower (Khmer: \u179a\u17c4\u1784\u179f\u17d2\u1782\u179a; Lao: \u0eab\u0ecd\u0e81\u0ead\u0e87; Thai: \u0e2b\u0e2d\u0e01\u0e25\u0e2d\u0e07)\nHong Song Nam (Thai: \u0e2b\u0e49\u0e2d\u0e07\u0e2a\u0e23\u0e07\u0e19\u0e49\u0e33): toilet.\nHo trai (Khmer: \u17a0\u17c4\u178f\u17d2\u179a\u17d0\u1799; Lao: \u0eab\u0ecd\u0ec4\u0e95; Thai: \u0e2b\u0e2d\u0e44\u0e15\u0e23): library where Buddhist texts are kept.\nKappapiya Kudi (Thai: \u0e01\u0e31\u0e1b\u0e1b\u0e34\u0e22\u0e01\u0e38\u0e0e\u0e35) utility and storage room.\nKod (Khmer: \u1780\u17bb\u178a\u17b7), Kut, Kutti, Kuti or Kati (Lao: \u0e81\u0eb8\u0e95\u0eb4, \u0e81\u0eb0\u0e95\u0eb4; Thai: \u0e01\u0e38\u0e0f\u0e34): the living quarters of monks separated from the sacred buildings.\nMondop (Khmer: \u1798\u178e\u17d2\u178c\u1794; Thai: \u0e21\u0e13\u0e11\u0e1b; from Sanskrit: Mandapa): usually an open, square building with four arches and a pyramidal roof, used to worship religious texts or objects.\nPond (Khmer: \u179f\u17d2\u179a\u17c7 - Srah; Lao: \u0eaa\u0eb0\u0e99\u0ec9\u0ecd\u0eb2 Sa Nam; Thai: \u0e2a\u0e23\u0e30\u0e19\u0e49\u0e33 Sa Nam): is rectangular in shape and sometimes decorated with lotus flowers, the emblematic flower of Buddhism.

          "This is wonderful place to escape the city hustle and bustle. Beautiful architecture and one can observe monks go about their daily lives. It's beside the national museum and Royal Palace - so drop by -it's free.",
          "This Temple looks very cool at night with a lot of LEDs but it also seems pretty artificial and to \"new\" But that is just my personal opinion.",
          "This temple on the Tonle Sap has a number of buildings, but is not of particular note, in my opinion. Someone wrote that they saw people working on the carvings. We saw men installing metal fixtures. If you are walking along the river, stop here, but in my opinion it is not",
          "The day we went to this beautifully maintained Wat, there were some visiting monks of some stature - lots of action and seats being set out and the somewhat strange sight of monks taking selfies and posing for photos with the dignitaries. There were very few other tourists, so",
          "My husband and I have visited many Wats throughout SE Asia and we agreed that this is our favorite. There were very few other people there, entrance is free, and it just felt more authentic. There are monks everywhere and the complex is quite large but well maintained. The",
          "If you are in PP you just must visit this Temple. It houses precious relic of Buddha In a small pagoda behind the main shrine.",
          "As it is in the center of the city we visited the Wat Ounalom. Interesting temple. We have seen closely the monks, A must see in Phnom penh",
          "Nice little temple. Quieter than others and very beautiful. Greeted by a large gold buddha and silver elephants. I enjoyed this one very much. Located close to royal palace",
          "Worth a visit if you are interested In Cambodian culture and religion ! Center of Cambodian Buddhism. No entrance fee",
          "By no means the prettiest Wats but it has a character and it seems more genuine as you see more monks living here and they are very friendly and nice to talk to.",
          "Centrally located next to Riverside Phnom Penh. But the recent renovation works, especially the use of the red color, looks highly unprofessional.",
          "You can't see every temple in Phnom Penh but do visit this one. Very different architecture and lots of monks busy in their activities Highly recommended",
          "I liked this Wat very much ... nothing super impressive but i went there in the mid day and it was calm and peaceful and I walked all around felt like a real 'kampung\" style in the alley in the back... but what i liked the most was it was QUIET .. the sound of nothing.. was",
          "I liked this visit, there was a ceremony going on, many monksfield, nuns and photographers present, so not the usual peaceful temple visit It's free to enter and walking distance to other sites so easy to include in trip",
          "I spend a few minutes here before going to the independent monument. It is a very classic Wat with many locals. Definitely worth to visit.",
          "This place, Wat Ounalom, is one of the finest Wats to visit in this area of Cambodia. It is also where the holiest Buddhist Monk resides in Cambodia. He happened to be there when I paid my visit. He blessed all of my group that was there. This is a once in a life time",
          "We went to visit one morning, there was no people and we enjoyed to visit a quiet place of prayer. You have to visit it!!!",
          "Yet another Wat. We have seen enough now to last a lifetime. Buddha was in his humble glory, very serene indeed",
          "Worth visiting when coming to river front to enjoy the evening walk. A few ancient stupa at the back of temple, don't miss it.",
          "The main attraction here is a stupa containing an eyebrow hair of Buddha with an inscription in Pali (an ancient Indian language) over the entrance.",
          "This lovely sleepy Wat, right next to the Royal Palace in Phnom Penh has a fabulous secret side. I have visited on 3 occassions now and on each visit I have witnessed beautifully intricate carving work taking place. On one visit a whole workshop was open and inside a number of",
          "Well, it is quite right in the heart of Phnom Penh, just 700 - 800m to Royal Palace. Standing through the time and destruction, it is survived by the dark age of Cambodia, Khmer Rouge. If you are interested in Buddha or Buddhism, feeling free coming to see things, it might help",
          "I've been to numerous wats in Thailand and Cambodia and while this one is quite nice it just doesn't stand out compared to other wats in other cities/countries. If this is your first time in Cambodia/Southeast Asia, definitely stop in as it very lovely but if this is your 50th",
          "a short cut from street 172 to the river and a nice place to walk through whilst observing the skills of the stonemasons and others in building this pagoda,of course comes with buddhist monks and statues.",
          "I like to visit the pagoda when i come to any country. And this pagoda did not disappoint me. You can know more about the Cambodia culture and architecture when you visit here.",
          "Went inside and found it interesting with so many statues of Buddhas and Buddhist Monks. Just a short walk from my hotel along the water front.",
          "It is not a must, but it is a beautiful building. Pass along if you visit the national museum, it's close by. When we were there it was decorated with coloured flags. Nice peaceful place.",
          "In my opinion its just another Wat pagoda, nothing special about this place and when i visited it look kinda empty. You can visit if you are already near but don't waste time to coming specially for that.",
          "I was horrified to find out that they have animal sacrifices here. They also do the so-called life release here as they do in many Buddhist temples. If not for these two details, this place would be wonderful.",
          "There is something about this \"oldest temple\" in Phnom Penh: storing one of the relics of Buddha Shakyamuni, monk blessing visitors, new buildings and the old (presumably original) sections, and the wide compound. Many have missed the small stupas behind the big tall building,",
          "We really enjoyed visiting Wat Ounalom, the site of Buddha's eyebrow. There weren't many tourists and we were able to enjoy the religious site in peaceful quietude. There were friendly monks who were happy to explain the significance of the temple and say a prayer with us.",
          "Very beautiful complex. Spend time vising all the surrounding - around 1 hour should be enough to slowly walk all around and enjoy the atmosphere",
          "Despite the tuk tuk drivers outside telling us \"twenty minutes open\" nearly an hour before we visited this temple properly, bizarrely at about 14:30, the main hall of this temple was still closed. Ignore the drivers at the main entrance, as they merely want you to buy their",
          "Around Royal Palace you can walk to many different Pagodas and you will certainly find one or even more monks talking with you You can of course just go in and stay in meditation or pray for some moments You may even find monks doing their daily rituals and with all respects due",
          "it is a series of temples near the royal palace/national museum. You can wander around the complex and see inside some of them for free. If your lucky you can see some of the monks go about their daily rituals.",
          "I stayed not far from it and went there daily for meditation, I meet a old monk who didn't speak English but he took me to the privite wat out back and gave me a blessing. Every humbling",
          "Super nice temples and immediate grounds. You can tell the complex has been there for many years. If you're lucky, you'll see the lines of monks going into the temples to pray. There's something different about this place. It somehow has something a little magical about it.",
          "do walk up and around for a peaceful wat in the heart of the city. simple and nice and houses some great snapshots of religion.",
          "Easy to find just by the Royal Palace compound. It is said to be dedicated as a repository for the remnants of some rich characters and financed by Mr. Hun Sen, present Prime Minister.",
          "After a week in Phnom Penh I must admit I walked past Wat Ounalom many times as I thought I had seen enough temples over my 4 week visit in Cambodia. I was on a Vespa tour when my guide was showing me around the Temple and said it's worth a look inside. I'm so glad we did they",
          "We stopped by on our way back to the hotel. We went inside and were greeted by a friendly old man who showed us inside one of the smaller temples in the back. Unique experience!",
          "If your on the river side, its worth giving this pagoda a quick look see. It's had a lot of work done to it over the past two years.",
          "Unlike most temple sites, this one is not crowded. But it is on the quay, and is quite pretty. It is also near the palace compound, so it is fairly close to where you are likely to be. Worth a stop.",
          "have a look if you are passing but do not bother seeking it out as nothing too impressive but central so one may be in the area",
          "This was the first Wat we visited in south east Asia, and it definitely set the bar high! Honestly I would say if you done have much time, see this one instead of Wat Phnom. Wat Ounalom is MUCH less crowded, and we weren't asked for money once (unlike the children at Wat Phnom,",
          "What a pleasant and awe inspiring surprise the painting on the inside of the Wat are! Wonderful place to visit. The grounds are another example of the relief that can be found in the heart of Phnom Penh from the traffic.",
          "This Wat has the most beautiful architecture and colors. When I visited, there was a Buddist class going on with lots of people taking notes. To me this is a must visit and its close to riverside and the palace. The Cambodian monks are very friendly and will in some cases",
          "It is one of the free wats that my tuktuk driver and I visited on 2.26.2016. We said our prayers, admired the beauty of our surroundings, and took lots of pictures. Saw more buildings toward the back of this attraction, appeared to be occupied and used by monks.",
          "We officially started our Phnom Penh tour with this place. The building roof is so beautiful and the interiors look serene. This is for free.",
          "The title says it all reqally. When we visited, there was a large group of (female) pilgrims who were so friendly and kept offering us cakes and bottles of water. A ceremony complete with monks and chanting was also held. I suppose you could be unlucky and not get the ceremony,",
          "Close to such attractions as the royal palace and national museum, Wat Ounalom can be easily overlooked. But it is well worth a visit. A center of Cambodian Buddhism, it has a history of several hundred years. Damaged by the Khmer rouge, it has been beautifully restored. Not",
          "This is a wonderful Wat, located just off the Riverside area. A wander through the grounds and the monks quarters is a welcome respite from the noise and traffic of the rest of the city.",
          "Very nice architecture though I would recommend only going if you're nearby. Not really worth its own trip. The tuk tuk drivers out front were particularly pesky; with multiple polite no's and no thank yous before they would stop pestering me with there details of tours.",
          "A visit to Wat Ounalom allows insight into the spiritual teachings, philosophies and history of Buddhism in Cambodia. Perhaps the most prominent and oldest of five pagodas in the country, Wat Ounalom is the centre of Cambodian Buddhism and serves as the abode of the Patriarch of",
          "If you only have time to visit one place in Phnom Penh, make it here! It's attractively situated in the river front area. We were lucky when we visited because the monks were celebrating some kind of reunion of three separate groups, and following a ritual service with",
          "Not only is this a lovely Pagoda, with moving Memorial stones to a Japanese reporter and others who perished during Cambodia's terrible civil war, but a small shrine at the back holds a most sacred relic of the Buddha. One of the defining characteristics of a Buddha is a coiled",
          "More to do in Phnom Penh are nothing much, but if you wandered you will always find something to do. The Sisowath Quay is one of the place in Phnom Penh where I love to stroll. Along this way to find the most stunning sights in Phnom Penh, the Royal Palace and this Temple are",
          "After you have finished at the Royal Palace, continue along the waterfront and pop Ito Wat Ounalum. It has been refurbished quite a few times over the years so it can feel a little 'bling bling', but it has a genuine community of worshippers and monks.",
          "We didn't intend to visit this temple, but came across it on our way to the royal palace, it looked so beautiful from outside that we had to go in. The buildings are just beautiful, thousands of buddhist and cambodian flags flapping in all directions, beautifuly adorned bells",
          "this is an extremely nice temple well worth a visit there is no entrance fees and it has some beutifull statues dotted around the yard.",
          "This is a large religious center located next to Royal Palace. The buildings are interesting and the history of the place is fascinating and heartbreaking. It was not one of the most interesting pagodas or centers we visited in Cambodia but was a nice stop while exploring the",
          "Near the Kings Palace and nestled on the riverside surrounded by lots of restaurants, this is a great place to randomly walk through and soak up the serene Buddhist atmosphere - no booking required! Was nervous to just wander through at first, but everyone so smiling and",
          "It was evident that Wat Ounalom has gone through renovations many times. The area is well-maintained and tiles look new. It is one of the better maintained temples in Cambodia. However, it is precisely this reason that makes this temple bland. If I have not heard anything about",
          "Obviously one of the most important buddhist temples in Cambodia, it's a nice respite from the crazy traffic all around. The Khmer Rouge must have done a lot of damage to it.",
          "Open and quiet Wat within a working monastry compound. The buildings are stately though not as overtly grandious. It is right next to the waterfront, so worth incorporating in your walk along the riverside.",
          "This is a nice temple and also the real temple as you can enjoy peaceful, quiet and pleasant walk within the temple. It is a must as you can spend less than an houe to take photo or talk with the monks id there is any.",
          "This place is definitely in a better shape than most temples in the Cambodian capital. Its cleanliness and organization definitely measure up to the beauty of the statues and buildings found there. Don`t miss it!",
          "Strolling the grounds is interesting to see a variety of the Buddhist temple buildings. One is a shrine that has an eyebrow hair of Buddha. In front of this small temple are some historic statues and a memorial to a Japanese reporter killed in the Vietnam war era. Best to go in",
          "This is a big but empty pagoda. There was a monk sitting at the front in discussion with a group of men but other than that there was very little to see. You don't need to spend more than 10 minutes here.",
          "Beautiful monastery with a peaceful atmosphere. I enjoyed walking in the gardens with the statues and stupas.",
          "Wat Ounalom is quiet and peaceful place, you can enjoy the cambodian architecture and difernts styles of statues, great gardens.",
          "This place is walkable from Sisowath Quay. The building was really pretty and the ambience was of an actual temple - not the touristy ones. Lots of statues in the area. I love it!",
          "Beautiful building in the grounds make this a must see if you're in Phnom Penh. Elephant statues and others in he surrounding gardens. Monks peacefully sleeping or reading in the temple. Took a tuk tuk from our hotel near the Central Market for $3US.",
          "Do drop in here for a visit. It is definitely worthwhile. The entrance arch is superb. I always drop in when passing because k enjoy the ambiance here.",
          "I went there in the early morning no crowd at all. One buddhist monk was sleeping there, neatly maintained. really worth visiting.",
          "Free temples near royal palace and riverfront, it's the most scenic of all temples in Phnom Penh. Look around as there are a few picturesque temples in the grounds.",
          "I arrived very early in the morning and was greeted by a grey haired old man who opened early for me. Then I was blessed and walked out feeling very special\u2026 Then an amazing thing happened. There was the sweetest tuk tuk driver who took me on a super adventure. I wanted to go",
          "Must see part of Phnom Penh. Beautiful grounds and great history. Recommend that you have a guide to get the history of the place.",
          "A visit to Wat Ounalom allows insight into the spiritual teachings, philosophies and history of Buddhism in Cambodia. As the name indicates, King Ponhea Yat - meaning \u2018Eyebrow Temple\u2019 - was built to enshrine an eyebrow hair (ounalom) of Lord Buddha, and the shrine was once home",
          "The style of this pagoda is a combination of 3 religions. Hindu and the two types of Buddhism. There is a Stupa behind this. Stupa is the eyebrow of Buddha. Good photographic opportunities.",
          "It's free! Unlike the Wat Phomn, you can freely enter, but do wear proper attire as this is a worship ground. Speak to the monks to get to know about the place.",
          "Wat Ounalom is yet another pagoda to visit in Phnom Penh. It is a peaceful and medium sized pagoda and free to visited. Worth visiting if you like buddhist architecture and pagodas and less touristy then the silver pagoda.",
          "Its for free!! this place is way too cute i took a lot of pictures outside, so what happened we didn't know that it closes around 1pm. ( take note of that!!) so we wasn't able to get inside the palace/pagoda. so even if we were not able to get inside we enjoy the place",
          "It's worth a visit. There is no entrance fees. Inside it is a very quiet place where you can just get around and take photos.",
          "It was very peaceful to wander around within the grounds. There were roosters wandering with us! Beautiful buildings and landscaping. Doesn't take long to see it, but a nice stop on the way to or from the palace. Very pretty and also free!",
          "Nice pagoda. But if you have seen any Buddhist temple don't waste your time. A couple of buildings with Buddha statues inside. Nothing special to see.",
          "We went on the day of new year as it was our last day here. Here there was a small get together just for locals. The temple isn't amazing itself and rather small. Everyone was staring at us and made us feel not welcome at all. Enjoy!",
          "A large Wat in the town centre. We wondered through as a short cut from our hotel towards the centre and found it enchanting. It is a working, worshiping and living area for the monks who you'll meet there. There are temples and stupas and things going on. There is no",
          "Small, quiet, worth a visit. We accidentally entered the Wat from the backdoor, but no one really said anything. We saw a small shrine where an old man beckoned to us. He gave us a blessing and was surprised when we donated a small amount. It was a cool experience. The Wat",
          "stopped by this Wat when I took a city tour from a tuktuk driver. its very pretty and peaceful. (plus no entrance fee)...i got scammed from a Viet monk though. he put a bead bracelet on me then demanded $2 for it. a Cambodian monk 'offered' a cambodian thread bracelet and",
          "If you are only in Phnom Penh for a short while then pop into Wat Ounalom which is so conveniently situated just off Sisowath Quay. It is a beautiful pagoda and if you are lucky you can engage with one of the many monks, some of whom speak reasonable English. Alternatively it a",
          "Walked in off the street. No hassles just peace and quiet. A working wat with the monks in residence. A peace of beauty the survived the horrors.",
          "This wat complex is located beside the Royal Palace and very close to the Riverside. If you are walking in the area just drop by and have a look inside. There is nothing really outstanding but especially in the evening it can be a relaxing break from the traffic of the streets.",
          "Some of my students stay here. Best to check it out around evening time before your dinner to catch some locals chilling around!",
          "Phnom Penh has to be the wort place on earth. Nothing but beggars and drug dealers. At this temple some tuk tuk guy as harassing me to take a ride before entering the temple. Following me and asking me again and again.... The temple looks nice on the outside, if you can get a",
          "As with a lot of Wats, the exterior is very impressive. However going into the pagoda shows it is either new or a lack of attention as it doesn't replicate the outside. We may have missed something that others didn't but certainly didn't have the splendour of any temples we had",
          "It's a very peaceful stop with plenty of opportunities for interesting photos. A security gentleman at the gate seemed truly interested in meeting people and welcoming them.",
          "I can't say much, you've got to experience it. It has retained its authenticity. Try to go there on a Saturday or Sunday when there is service. And yes, it is important to tip, even there, especially there. You might experience something that will stay with you forever. I wish",
          "An impressive temple complex, unfortunately many of the displays listed in Lonely Planet were locked up.",
          "This review is quite late. Wat Ounalom is a beautiful temple located along Sothearos Blvd near Sisowath Quay. It is the most important temple in Phnom Penh being the center of Buddhism. A visit to this temple can be combined with a trip to the nearby Wat Phnom.",
          "Behind big red walls, this is the spiritual heart of Cambodia. There are some nice temple buildings and some lovely old colonial French houses inside the complex.",
          "A great place to go also for meditation. The building is beautiful as many others in the city but the atmosphere there is unique!",
          "This is one of the most ignored places in Phnom Penh, i think. I asked some of the travelers in our hostel if they have been there and they even don't know that it exist. Maybe Wat Ounalom is an underrated temple in Phnom Penh. Since it is just a walk from our hostel, we",
          "Considering the wealth of architectural beauty around and about, this site does not really match up to the best that Phnom Penh offers. The main temple is barren, with perhaps a simpler approach to worship.",
          "Nice temple in the heart of the city's hustle and bustle. Too bad that there are a lot of beggars milling about. Great place to walk around in and find a semblance of peace in the city.",
          "This is a great beautiful tower. Dont get me wrong there are a lot of them in SE asia but that doesnt make this 1 any less beautiful. Its as good if not better than Wat Phnom but also free. If your in the area come inside, take some photos and check it out!",
          "This a beautiful serene place to reflect and meditate......it was quiet when we were there. We took Tuk Tuk and this was our driver's favorite destination !",
          "This temple was quite quiet when I went but that also meant some nice time for reflection as well as a good chance to take photos without rubbing elbows with other tourists",
          "When we visited this temple not many other visitors were around. The temple itself is quite impressive and well maintained. Some kids are playing around, old people walking around, and cats sleeping around. When you get to the lower side entrance of one of the temples an old",
          "Nice walk around the temple. You can seethe monks living there; it would be interesting to take a guide to explain you about the history (which I didn't). Very easy to find, infront of Mekong River.",
          "Another of the beautiful temples of Phnom Phen, theWat Ounalom located not far from the Royal Palace, this amazing temple is accessible and open to everyone without restriction, no ticket fee and no problems for photos or video inside, a place of peace and tranquility where",
          "Impressive architecture. One stupa is open to visitors where a monk will bless you for a dollar. The stupa is said to hold the cremated eyebrow hair of the buddha.",
          "Wat Ounalom is well worth a visit. It's located just north of the centre of town. The structure is quite impressive and nice to walk around.",
          "There are several buildings on the grounds, and only one was open to visitors. The architecture is lovely. There is a large memorial photo of the late king, honoring him, at an altar. There were several Buddhist monks present during my visit.",
          "I really liked visiting this temple complex. We arrived early in the morning (0730) and were the only ones there. That enhanced the tranquility and our ability to look around. One of the caretakers took a special interest in us and showed us around with halting English",
          "Keeper was very helpful and opened up even though he was in the middle of lunch. Not so sure of the blessing and being sprayed with water though. Not many people at this location and no English signage",
          "it was an ok visit, unfortunately temples in Cambodia are often open only few hours very early in the morning so we couldn't see much of it.",
          "very fine, quiet, is the seat of most important pope in cambodja, it has been the firt wat i've seen just arrived in Phnom penh",
          "Wat Ounalom is quite easy to reach and visit for no fee, close to the riverfront. It does not offer much except its outward aspect, the inner buildings are a little bit disappointing. The best photo opportunity is the main building framed by the main entrance. If you are short",
          "We were told to go to the other (more famous) Wat in town (forgotten the name) and we did visit both but found this one much more picturesque and and quietly beautiful",
          "Wat Ounalom is an easy site to tick off your list whilst in Phnom Penh as it is so close to the riverfront and a swag of accommodation options. It has no real entry fee though of course a donation is appreciated. Perhaps the best aspect of this place is it's exterior",
          "Situated close by the riverfront and Royal Palace, this is well worth a visit. Great views from the pagoda. Five different golden Buddhas line up at the front for offerings. I was blessed by a monk in one of the smaller temples in the complex. 350 monks live here.",
          "Nice temple not far from Royal Palace, worth popping in for a few photos if you're nearby. Not really worth a special trip unless you're a big temple freak -- the Royal Palace offers much more. Evidently they have some free public performances at set times, which I missed.",
          "I stayed here in phompenh for like 5 months earlier and i never visited the site, this time i looked it inside and found it peaceful and mostly like hindu temple. I liked it.",
          "If you're staying the area or just have a little free time it's an interesting place to visit and take a look around. A monk pulled us aside and showed us a relic that was supposedly one of Buddha's eyelashes. He took us in a little structure where he did some prayers to Buddha",
          "No queues and no ticket required. Has lovely temples and surrounds. Wasn't hassled by tuk tuk drivers on the way out either. Short walk from here to the Royal Palace and National Museum.",
          "The Wat Ounalom gave us a very emotional experience today - this pagoda, not rich decorated like others, has a special place for the Khmers and you can feel it, as soon you enter the pagoda. You hear the praying of the people and feel their relationship to the Buddhism. On the",
          "One of the monks liked that I patted his cat, so he opened up the original temple behind the big one up front and gave my GF and I a blessing, then closed up after leaving the rest of the tourists milling around wondering how they can get a blessing. Be nice to cats here people.",
          "If you're passing get your driver to stop. It's worth a look and all are welcome. Be careful of children begging, they are persistent even if you give them money.",

          "The wat is nice, on a hillside, you have to walk up for a little while and it turned out a bit confusing to find the actual entry. Inside the wat looks pretty nice and wellmade, but I have seen so many wats that I was hardly impressed anymore. Right next to the door to the",
          "Between here and Thailand, I have seen so many great temples. This ain't one of them. Go if you've nothing better to do. You could possibly snap a few good pics but look out for scammers. I was approached by two within a few minutes.",
          "In the tourist heat of PP next to the riverfront, this large pagoda complex can be busy with festivals, and peacefully quiet at the same time. It's a pleasure wander around, chat to the monks and local kids and see the charity school.",
          "Peaceful tranquil. Starkly contrasted to cambodian night life. Visit early morning. Sit kneeled infront of Buddha and hear the monks chanting in the tranquil coolness of the morning. Yes...peace is present right within the premises. :)",
          "It located next to Royal Palace and very near with National Museum. No entrance fee. Try to come early morning as it can be very hot and no place to take a shade.",
          "Great architecture, friendly monks, and a spot to kneel and reflect on life and limb. Cool inside, hot outside and the beads of sweat gained climbing up to the main hall evaporate into a fine cooling breeze of both the skin and the soul.",
          "I suppose everyone else was at Wat Phnom, because this particular Wat was basically deserted. It is located along the main stretch (by the water, between the Royal Palce and Wat Phnom, near the Central Market, not at all out of the way), yet somehow preserves its anonymity.",

          "Unlike the Royal Palace and Silver Pagoda, this nearby Wat was ransacked by the Khmer Rouge under Pol Pot so most of what you can see is either new or repaired. It is, however, the headquarters of Cambodian Buddhism and it is easy to find a knowledgeable and English speaking",

        "wiki": "The Fall of Phnom Penh was the capture of Phnom Penh, the capital of the Khmer Republic, by the Khmer Rouge on 17 April 1975, effectively ending the Cambodian Civil War. At the beginning of April 1975, Phnom Penh, one of the last remaining strongholds of the Khmer Republic, was surrounded by the Khmer Rouge and totally dependent on aerial resupply through Pochentong Airport. With a Khmer Rouge victory imminent, the US government evacuated US nationals and allied Cambodians on 12 April 1975. On 17 April the Khmer Republic government evacuated the city, intending to establish a new government center close to the Thai border to continue resistance. Later that day the last defences around Phnom Penh were overrun, and the Khmer Rouge occupied Phnom Penh.\nCaptured Khmer Republic forces were taken to the Olympic Stadium where they were executed, while senior government and military leaders were forced to write confessions prior to their executions. The Khmer Rouge ordered the evacuation of Phnom Penh, emptying the city except for expatriates who took refuge in the French Embassy until 30 April when they were transported to Thailand.\n\n\n== Background ==\nAt the beginning of 1975 the Khmer Republic, a United States-supported military government, controlled only the Phnom Penh area and a string of towns along the Mekong River that provided the crucial supply route for food and munitions coming upriver from South Vietnam. As part of their 1975 dry season offensive, rather than renewing their frontal attacks on Phnom Penh, the Khmer Rouge set out to cut the crucial Mekong supply route. On 12 January 1975 the Khmer Rouge attacked Neak Luong, a key Khmer National Armed Forces (FANK) defensive outpost on the Mekong. On 27 January, seven vessels limped into Phnom Penh, the survivors of a 16-ship convoy that had come under attack during the 100 kilometres (62 mi) journey from the South Vietnamese border. On 3 February a convoy heading downriver hit naval mines laid by the Khmer Rouge at Ph\u00fa M\u1ef9, approximately 74 kilometres (46 mi) from Phnom Penh. The Khmer National Navy (MNK) had mine-sweeping capability, but due to the Khmer Rouge control of the riverbanks mine-sweeping was impossible or, at best, extremely costly. The MNK had lost a quarter of its ships, and 70 percent of its sailors had been killed or wounded.By 17 February, the Khmer Republic abandoned attempts to reopen the Mekong supply line; all subsequent supplies for Phnom Penh would have to come in by air to Pochentong Airport. The United States quickly mobilised an airlift of food, fuel and ammunition into Phnom Penh, but as US support for the Khmer Republic was limited by the Case\u2013Church Amendment, BirdAir, a company under contract to the US Government, controlled the airlift with a mixed fleet of C-130 and DC-8 planes, flying 20 times a day into Pochentong from U-Tapao Royal Thai Navy Airfield.On 5 March, Khmer Rouge artillery at Toul Leap (11.574\u00b0N 104.757\u00b0E\ufeff / 11.574; 104.757), north-west of Phnom Penh, shelled Pochentong Airport, but FANK troops recaptured Toul Leap on 15 March and ended the shelling. Khmer Rouge forces continued to close in to the north and west of the city and were soon able to fire on Pochentong again. On 22 March rockets hit two supply aircraft, forcing the US Embassy to announce on 23 March a suspension of the airlift until the security situation improved. The Embassy, realizing that the Khmer Republic would soon collapse without supplies, reversed the suspension on 24 March and increased the number of aircraft available for the airlift. The hope among the Khmer Government and the Embassy was that the Khmer Rouge offensive could be held back until the start of the rainy season in May when fighting typically abated.\n\n\n== Offensive ==\n\n\n=== Late March ===\nBy late March the FANK maintained a defensive perimeter some 15 kilometres (9.3 mi) from central Phnom Penh. In the northwest, the 7th Division was in an increasingly difficult position, its front had been cut in several places, particularly in the region of Toul Leap which had changed hands several times. The 3rd Division, located on Route 4 in the vicinity of Bek Chan (11.51\u00b0N 104.748\u00b0E\ufeff / 11.51; 104.748), some 10 kilometres (6.2 mi) west of Pochentong was cut off from its own command post at Kompong Speu.In the south, the 1st Division handled the defense, along with the 15th Brigade of Brigadier General Lon Non; it was the calmest part of the front at that time. In the region of Takhmau, Route 1 and the Bassac River, the 1st Division was subject to continued Khmer Rouge pressure. East of the capital were the Parachute Brigade and the troops of the Phnom Penh Military Region. The MNK naval base on the Chrouy Changvar peninsula (11.583\u00b0N 104.916\u00b0E\ufeff / 11.583; 104.916) and the Khmer Air Force (KAF) base at Pochentong were defended by their own forces. The key position of Neak Luong on the east bank of the Mekong was completely isolated. The KAF and the MNK were overstretched and undersupplied and could not satisfy the demands of the FANK. The general logistic situation for FANK was increasingly critical and the resupply of ammunition for the infantry could only be carried out sporadically.\n\n\n=== 1 April ===\nPremier Lon Nol resigned on 1 April. The departure ceremony at the Chamcar Mon Palace was attended by Khmer only, the diplomatic corps having not been invited. From the grounds of Chamcar Mon, helicopters took Lon Nol, his family and party to Pochentong, where Lon Nol met US Ambassador John Gunther Dean before boarding an Air Cambodge flight to U-Tapao in Thailand and into exile. Saukam Khoy became acting President and it was hoped that with Lon Nol's departure peace negotiations could progress.The rapidly worsening situation of March was capped on the night of 1 April by the fall of Neak Luong, despite ferocious resistance and following a three-month siege. This development opened the southern approach to the capital and freed up 6000 Khmer Rouge soldiers to join the forces besieging Phnom Penh. The capture of six 105-mm howitzers at Neak Luong was a further menace to the capital.\n\n\n=== 2\u201311 April ===\nFrom 3\u20134 April all FANK positions on Route 1 above Neak Luong held by the FANK 1st Division fell one after the other, any reinforcement, whether by road or by the Mekong, was impossible. North of the capital, in the 7th Division area, Khmer Rouge attacks came daily and despite regular air support, there was no improvement in the situation there. Several counterattacks by FANK, carried out to retake lost positions, were unsuccessful. The losses suffered by the 1st Division grew each day and the evacuation of its sick and wounded by helicopter was no longer possible. The last reserves of the high command, constituted by hastily taking the battalions of the former Provincial Guard, were rushed to the north, only to be completely dispersed by the Khmer Rouge after several hours of combat. A great breach was opened in the northern defenses; there was not hope of closing it. To the west, the troops of Brigadier General Chantaraingsei's 3rd Division, despite reinforcements, were unable to join with their own elements at Kompong Speu and to retake the position at Toul Leap. A computation error which caused FANK artillery fire to land on 3rd Division elements during this operation had a bad effect on the unit's morale.Throughout this period civilian refugees fled toward the capital from all directions. The authorities, both civil and military, were swamped and no one knew where to lodge them. Schools, pagodas and public gardens were occupied by these refugees and there was no way for the authorities to determine who was friend and who was Khmer Rouge.On 11 April in Peking the US Government requested the immediate return of Prince Norodom Sihanouk, the figurehead leader of the National United Front of Kampuchea (FUNK), to Phnom Penh. Sihanouk rejected the request the following morning.\n\n\n=== 12 April ===\n\nWith the situation worsening in Phnom Penh, on 12 April the US Embassy initiated Operation Eagle Pull, the evacuation of all US personnel. Ambassador Dean invited the members of the Government to be evacuated, but all refused except for acting President Saukham Khoy, who left without telling his fellow leaders. The evacuation came as a shock to many in the Khmer Republic leadership, because not only Phnom Penh but almost all provincial capitals (except those in the east occupied by the North Vietnamese) were in the hands of the government, packed with millions of refugees. Estimates put the population under government control at six million, and those under Khmer Rouge control at one million.At 08:30, the Council of Ministers met in the office of Prime Minister Long Boret. It was decided that a general assembly should be convoked, consisting of the highest functionaries and military leaders. From 14:00 the general assembly sat in the Chamcar Mon Palace. It finally adopted a unanimous resolution asking for the transfer of power to the military and condemning Saukham Khoy for not handing over his office in a legitimate way. At 23:00 the general assembly elected the members of the Supreme Committee: Lieutenant general Sak Sutsakhan, the FANK Chief of Staff, Major General Thongvan Fanmuong, MNK Rear admiral Vong Sarendy, KAF commander Brigadier general Ea Chhong, Long Boret, Hang Thun Hak, Vice Prime Minister and Op Kim Ang: representative of the Social Republican Party.The military situation had deteriorated sharply during the day. In the north the defensive line was cut at several points by the Khmer Rouge, in spite of the fierce resistance by FANK units. Pochentong Airport was in imminent danger of being taken; the small military airport of Mean Chey had to be designated as an emergency landing place for the planes and helicopters bringing ammunition and supplies.\n\n\n=== 13\u201316 April ===\n \n13 April was the Cambodian New Year and the Khmer Rouge continued to bombard Phnom Penh. At 09:00 the Supreme Committee had its first session and unanimously elected Sak Sutsakhan president, becoming both the head of the government and interim Chief of State. Sak decided to make a last peace offer to Prince Sihanouk, transferring the Republic and its armed forces to him, but not surrendering to the Khmer Rouge. Late that night Sak called a meeting of the Council of Ministers, this time consisting of both the Supreme Committee and the Cabinet, made decisions including certain political and military measures, channeling the ever increasing stream of refugees into schools, pagodas, their feeding, the reshuffling of the cabinet, reinforcing the troops in Phnom Penh by flying in a few battalions from different provinces through the Mean Chey airport and the formation of an Ad Hoc Committee chaired by Long Boret to prepare peace overtures for either Prince Sihanouk or the Khmer Rouge.On 14 April the military situation was becoming increasingly precarious. That morning the Cabinet met at Sak's office at the General Staff Headquarters (11.567\u00b0N 104.925\u00b0E\ufeff / 11.567; 104.925). At 10:25 a KAF pilot dropped four 250-pound bombs from his T-28 fighter bomber. Two of the bombs exploded about 20 yards (18 m) from Sak's office killing seven officers and NCOs and wounded twenty others. Sak declared a 24-hour curfew and that the battle would continue. That afternoon Takhmau, the capital of Kandal Province, 11 kilometres (6.8 mi) south of Phnom Penh fell to the Khmer Rouge. The loss of this town, a key point in the FANK defense perimeter, had a demoralizing effect. Several counterattacks were initiated but to no avail. Soon a fierce battle was in progress in the southern suburbs. The U.S. aerial resupply into Pochentong was completely halted.The 15th began with the Khmer Rouge pressing in from north and west. Pochentong and the dike running east/west to the north of Phnom Penh, both of which formed the last ring of defense around the capital, were overrun by Khmer Rouge assaults. The intervention of the Parachute Brigade, brought back from the east of the Mekong, had no effect on the situation to the west of the capital. The brigade tried to move west, but was only able to get 6 kilometres (3.7 mi) down Route 4. Meanwhile, refugees continued to pour into the city.\n\nOn 16 April, the morning Cabinet meeting was devoted entirely to the mechanics of sending a peace offer to Peking as quickly as possible. Long Boret drafted the offer calling for an immediate ceasefire and a transfer of power to FUNK. The offer was sent to Peking via the Red Cross and the Agence France-Presse. The military situation was becoming worse, the Shell oil depot (11.607\u00b0N 104.917\u00b0E\ufeff / 11.607; 104.917) north of the city was set ablaze by gunfire, while fire swept shacks to the south of the city. All afternoon the Cabinet waited for the answer from Peking. By 23:00 an answer had still not arrived and the Cabinet realized that the Khmer Rouge did not want to accept the offer. Meanwhile, the Khmer Rouge had occupied the east bank of the Mekong following the withdrawal of the Parachute Brigade, while General Dien Del\u2019s 2nd Division held the Monivong Bridge.KAF T-28Ds flew their last combat sortie by bombing the KAF control centre and hangars at Pochentong upon its capture by the Khmer Rouge. After virtually expending their ordnance reserves, 97 KAF aircraft escaped from airbases and auxiliary airfields throughout Cambodia, with a small number of civilian dependents on board, to safe havens in neighbouring Thailand.\n\n\n=== 17 April ===\n\nAt 02:00 on 17 April the Cabinet agreed that, as its peace offer had not been accepted, it would move the Cabinet, the Supreme Committee and even members of the Assembly from Phnom Penh to the north to the capital of Oddar Meanchey Province on the Thai border in order to continue resistance from there. The only way to leave the capital was by helicopter. At 04:00 the members of the Government met in the garden in front of the Wat Botum Vaddey (11.559\u00b0N 104.932\u00b0E\ufeff / 11.559; 104.932) for evacuation, but the helicopters did not show up. Dawn was breaking over the eastern horizon. The Government members returned to Premier Long Boret's house at 05:30 and decided to resist to the death in Phnom Penh itself. After 06:00, the Minister of Information, Thong Lim Huong, brought a cable just arrived from Peking advising that the peace appeal had been rejected by Sihanouk. At the same time they branded the seven members of the Supreme Committee as chief traitors, in addition to the seven who had taken power in 1970.Heavy fighting had been taking place since 04:00 in the north of the city around the main power station (11.59\u00b0N 104.915\u00b0E\ufeff / 11.59; 104.915). By dawn the firing ceased as the FANK forces gave way to the Khmer Rouge and retreated along Monivong Boulevard into the city center. Admiral Vong Sarendy had returned to the naval base which was under attack by the Khmer Rouge. He called Sak later advising that the base was surrounded and about to be overrun. As Khmer Rouge forces entered the command post Sarendy committed suicide.By 08:00 the rest of the Cabinet, the deputies and the senators left the session, leaving Long Boret and Sak. General Thach Reng arrived to plead with them to leave with him, as he still had his men of the Special Forces and seven UH-1 helicopters at his disposal at the Olympic Stadium. At approximately 08:30 Sak and his family boarded a helicopter and were flown out, as was KAF commander Ea Chhong. Meanwhile, Long Boret boarded another helicopter which failed to take off. Four helicopters flew to Kampong Thom to refuel, arriving at 09:30. Establishing radio contact with Phnom Penh, Sak learned that the Khmer Rouge had penetrated into the General Staff Headquarters. General Mey Sichan addressed the nation and the troops in Sak's name asking them to hoist the white flag as a sign of peace. Sak's helicopter arrived at Oddar Meanchey at 13:30, as the collapse of the Republic was imminent. Any chance of reestablishing the Government evaporated and the assembled officers decided to seek exile in Thailand.As the Khmer Rouge entered the capital, a small group of soldiers and armed students, styled as the MONATIO and led by Hem Keth Dara, began driving around the city welcoming the arrival of the Khmer Rouge. MONATIO was apparently a creation of Lon Non, in an attempt to share power with the Khmer Rouge. Initially tolerated by the Khmer Rouge, MONATIO members were later rounded up and executed.Several hours later the Khmer Rouge began entering central Phnom Penh from all directions and stationed themselves at the major crossroads where they disarmed FANK soldiers and collected weapons. The disarmed soldiers were then marched to the Olympic Stadium where they were later executed. The Khmer Rouge held a press conference at the Ministry of Information where a number of prisoners, including Lon Non and Hem Keth Dara, were being held. A car carrying Long Boret arrived and he joined the prisoners.After midday the Khmer Rouge ordered the evacuation of the city for three days, evicting expatriates and Cambodians from the Hotel Le Phnom which the Red Cross had sought to establish as a neutral zone, and emptying the city's hospitals which contained approximately 20,000 wounded who were unlikely to survive the walk to the countryside. Approximately 800 expatriates and 600 Cambodians took refuge at the French Embassy (11.583\u00b0N 104.916\u00b0E\ufeff / 11.583; 104.916). At this time the Khmer Rouge military numbered only 68,000, with a further 14,000 party members. Elizabeth Becker asserts that lacking the numbers necessary to openly control Cambodia, emptying Phnom Penh of those of its population who were indifferent or openly hostile to them was essential for securing Khmer Rouge control.Koy Thuon, a Khmer Rouge deputy front commander, organized the \"Committee for Wiping Out Enemies\" at the Hotel Monorom (11.57\u00b0N 104.918\u00b0E\ufeff / 11.57; 104.918). Its first action was to order the immediate execution of Lon Nol and other leading government figures. Captured FANK officers were taken to the Hotel Monoram to write their biographies and then to the Olympic Stadium, where they were executed.\n\n\n== Aftermath ==\nOn the morning of 18 April, Sak and the remaining members of the Khmer Republic Government and assorted military personnel boarded a KAF C-123 and flew to U-Tapao and into exile. The same day the Khmer Rouge ordered all Cambodians in the French Embassy, other than women married to Frenchmen, to leave the Embassy or they would take it over; they rejected any right of asylum. Among those evicted was Prince Sisowath Sirik Matak, one of those responsible for the removal of Sihanouk from power in 1970 and who had been branded one of the seven original traitors marked for execution by the FUNK. Also evicted were Princess Mam Manivan Phanivong, one of Sihanouk's wives; Khy-Taing Lim, the Minister of Finance; and Loeung Nal, the Minister of Health.Long Boret was executed on the grounds of the Cercle Sportif in Phnom Penh (ironically now the location of the US Embassy) on or about 21 April. Khmer Rouge Radio subsequently reported that he had been beheaded but other reports indicate that he and Sisowath Sirik Matak were executed by firing squad or that he was shot in the kidney and left to suffer a slow death, while his family were executed by machine gun fire.Pol Pot arrived in a deserted Phnom Penh on 23 April. On 30 April the occupants of the French Embassy were loaded onto trucks and driven to the Thai border arriving four days later.The collapse of the Khmer Republic following the Fall of Phnom Penh allowed the Khmer Rouge to consolidate their control over Cambodia and begin the implementation of their agrarian socialism. Supporters of the Khmer Republic and the intelligentsia were killed, while the former urban population was used as forced labor in the countryside with many dying from physical abuse and malnutrition. This ultimately resulting in 1.5-2 million deaths during the Cambodian Genocide.The Khmer Rouge severed all contact with the outside world other than with its supporters, China and North Vietnam. With the Fall of Saigon on 30 April 1975 the Khmer Rouge demanded that all People's Army of Vietnam (PAVN) and Viet Cong forces leave their base areas in Cambodia, but the PAVN refused to leave certain areas which they claimed were Vietnamese territory. The PAVN also moved to take control of a number of islands formerly controlled by South Vietnam and other territory and islands contested between Vietnam and Cambodia. This led to a series of clashes between Vietnam and Cambodia on several islands in May 1975 and the seizure of foreign ships by the Khmer Rouge which triggered the Mayaguez incident. Clashes between Cambodia and Vietnam continued until August 1975. Relations between the two countries improved thereafter until early 1977 when the Kampuchean Revolutionary Army began attacking Vietnamese border provinces, killing hundreds of Vietnamese civilians; this eventually resulted in the Cambodian\u2013Vietnamese War starting in December 1978.\n\n\n== In popular culture ==\nThe Fall of Phnom Penh is depicted in the film The Killing Fields.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nVideo of Roland Neveu discussing his photos from the fall of Phnom Penh",

        "wiki": "The Fall of Phnom Penh was the capture of Phnom Penh, the capital of the Khmer Republic, by the Khmer Rouge on 17 April 1975, effectively ending the Cambodian Civil War. At the beginning of April 1975, Phnom Penh, one of the last remaining strongholds of the Khmer Republic, was surrounded by the Khmer Rouge and totally dependent on aerial resupply through Pochentong Airport. With a Khmer Rouge victory imminent, the US government evacuated US nationals and allied Cambodians on 12 April 1975. On 17 April the Khmer Republic government evacuated the city, intending to establish a new government center close to the Thai border to continue resistance. Later that day the last defences around Phnom Penh were overrun, and the Khmer Rouge occupied Phnom Penh.\nCaptured Khmer Republic forces were taken to the Olympic Stadium where they were executed, while senior government and military leaders were forced to write confessions prior to their executions. The Khmer Rouge ordered the evacuation of Phnom Penh, emptying the city except for expatriates who took refuge in the French Embassy until 30 April when they were transported to Thailand.\n\n\n== Background ==\nAt the beginning of 1975 the Khmer Republic, a United States-supported military government, controlled only the Phnom Penh area and a string of towns along the Mekong River that provided the crucial supply route for food and munitions coming upriver from South Vietnam. As part of their 1975 dry season offensive, rather than renewing their frontal attacks on Phnom Penh, the Khmer Rouge set out to cut the crucial Mekong supply route. On 12 January 1975 the Khmer Rouge attacked Neak Luong, a key Khmer National Armed Forces (FANK) defensive outpost on the Mekong. On 27 January, seven vessels limped into Phnom Penh, the survivors of a 16-ship convoy that had come under attack during the 100 kilometres (62 mi) journey from the South Vietnamese border. On 3 February a convoy heading downriver hit naval mines laid by the Khmer Rouge at Ph\u00fa M\u1ef9, approximately 74 kilometres (46 mi) from Phnom Penh. The Khmer National Navy (MNK) had mine-sweeping capability, but due to the Khmer Rouge control of the riverbanks mine-sweeping was impossible or, at best, extremely costly. The MNK had lost a quarter of its ships, and 70 percent of its sailors had been killed or wounded.By 17 February, the Khmer Republic abandoned attempts to reopen the Mekong supply line; all subsequent supplies for Phnom Penh would have to come in by air to Pochentong Airport. The United States quickly mobilised an airlift of food, fuel and ammunition into Phnom Penh, but as US support for the Khmer Republic was limited by the Case\u2013Church Amendment, BirdAir, a company under contract to the US Government, controlled the airlift with a mixed fleet of C-130 and DC-8 planes, flying 20 times a day into Pochentong from U-Tapao Royal Thai Navy Airfield.On 5 March, Khmer Rouge artillery at Toul Leap (11.574\u00b0N 104.757\u00b0E\ufeff / 11.574; 104.757), north-west of Phnom Penh, shelled Pochentong Airport, but FANK troops recaptured Toul Leap on 15 March and ended the shelling. Khmer Rouge forces continued to close in to the north and west of the city and were soon able to fire on Pochentong again. On 22 March rockets hit two supply aircraft, forcing the US Embassy to announce on 23 March a suspension of the airlift until the security situation improved. The Embassy, realizing that the Khmer Republic would soon collapse without supplies, reversed the suspension on 24 March and increased the number of aircraft available for the airlift. The hope among the Khmer Government and the Embassy was that the Khmer Rouge offensive could be held back until the start of the rainy season in May when fighting typically abated.\n\n\n== Offensive ==\n\n\n=== Late March ===\nBy late March the FANK maintained a defensive perimeter some 15 kilometres (9.3 mi) from central Phnom Penh. In the northwest, the 7th Division was in an increasingly difficult position, its front had been cut in several places, particularly in the region of Toul Leap which had changed hands several times. The 3rd Division, located on Route 4 in the vicinity of Bek Chan (11.51\u00b0N 104.748\u00b0E\ufeff / 11.51; 104.748), some 10 kilometres (6.2 mi) west of Pochentong was cut off from its own command post at Kompong Speu.In the south, the 1st Division handled the defense, along with the 15th Brigade of Brigadier General Lon Non; it was the calmest part of the front at that time. In the region of Takhmau, Route 1 and the Bassac River, the 1st Division was subject to continued Khmer Rouge pressure. East of the capital were the Parachute Brigade and the troops of the Phnom Penh Military Region. The MNK naval base on the Chrouy Changvar peninsula (11.583\u00b0N 104.916\u00b0E\ufeff / 11.583; 104.916) and the Khmer Air Force (KAF) base at Pochentong were defended by their own forces. The key position of Neak Luong on the east bank of the Mekong was completely isolated. The KAF and the MNK were overstretched and undersupplied and could not satisfy the demands of the FANK. The general logistic situation for FANK was increasingly critical and the resupply of ammunition for the infantry could only be carried out sporadically.\n\n\n=== 1 April ===\nPremier Lon Nol resigned on 1 April. The departure ceremony at the Chamcar Mon Palace was attended by Khmer only, the diplomatic corps having not been invited. From the grounds of Chamcar Mon, helicopters took Lon Nol, his family and party to Pochentong, where Lon Nol met US Ambassador John Gunther Dean before boarding an Air Cambodge flight to U-Tapao in Thailand and into exile. Saukam Khoy became acting President and it was hoped that with Lon Nol's departure peace negotiations could progress.The rapidly worsening situation of March was capped on the night of 1 April by the fall of Neak Luong, despite ferocious resistance and following a three-month siege. This development opened the southern approach to the capital and freed up 6000 Khmer Rouge soldiers to join the forces besieging Phnom Penh. The capture of six 105-mm howitzers at Neak Luong was a further menace to the capital.\n\n\n=== 2\u201311 April ===\nFrom 3\u20134 April all FANK positions on Route 1 above Neak Luong held by the FANK 1st Division fell one after the other, any reinforcement, whether by road or by the Mekong, was impossible. North of the capital, in the 7th Division area, Khmer Rouge attacks came daily and despite regular air support, there was no improvement in the situation there. Several counterattacks by FANK, carried out to retake lost positions, were unsuccessful. The losses suffered by the 1st Division grew each day and the evacuation of its sick and wounded by helicopter was no longer possible. The last reserves of the high command, constituted by hastily taking the battalions of the former Provincial Guard, were rushed to the north, only to be completely dispersed by the Khmer Rouge after several hours of combat. A great breach was opened in the northern defenses; there was not hope of closing it. To the west, the troops of Brigadier General Chantaraingsei's 3rd Division, despite reinforcements, were unable to join with their own elements at Kompong Speu and to retake the position at Toul Leap. A computation error which caused FANK artillery fire to land on 3rd Division elements during this operation had a bad effect on the unit's morale.Throughout this period civilian refugees fled toward the capital from all directions. The authorities, both civil and military, were swamped and no one knew where to lodge them. Schools, pagodas and public gardens were occupied by these refugees and there was no way for the authorities to determine who was friend and who was Khmer Rouge.On 11 April in Peking the US Government requested the immediate return of Prince Norodom Sihanouk, the figurehead leader of the National United Front of Kampuchea (FUNK), to Phnom Penh. Sihanouk rejected the request the following morning.\n\n\n=== 12 April ===\n\nWith the situation worsening in Phnom Penh, on 12 April the US Embassy initiated Operation Eagle Pull, the evacuation of all US personnel. Ambassador Dean invited the members of the Government to be evacuated, but all refused except for acting President Saukham Khoy, who left without telling his fellow leaders. The evacuation came as a shock to many in the Khmer Republic leadership, because not only Phnom Penh but almost all provincial capitals (except those in the east occupied by the North Vietnamese) were in the hands of the government, packed with millions of refugees. Estimates put the population under government control at six million, and those under Khmer Rouge control at one million.At 08:30, the Council of Ministers met in the office of Prime Minister Long Boret. It was decided that a general assembly should be convoked, consisting of the highest functionaries and military leaders. From 14:00 the general assembly sat in the Chamcar Mon Palace. It finally adopted a unanimous resolution asking for the transfer of power to the military and condemning Saukham Khoy for not handing over his office in a legitimate way. At 23:00 the general assembly elected the members of the Supreme Committee: Lieutenant general Sak Sutsakhan, the FANK Chief of Staff, Major General Thongvan Fanmuong, MNK Rear admiral Vong Sarendy, KAF commander Brigadier general Ea Chhong, Long Boret, Hang Thun Hak, Vice Prime Minister and Op Kim Ang: representative of the Social Republican Party.The military situation had deteriorated sharply during the day. In the north the defensive line was cut at several points by the Khmer Rouge, in spite of the fierce resistance by FANK units. Pochentong Airport was in imminent danger of being taken; the small military airport of Mean Chey had to be designated as an emergency landing place for the planes and helicopters bringing ammunition and supplies.\n\n\n=== 13\u201316 April ===\n \n13 April was the Cambodian New Year and the Khmer Rouge continued to bombard Phnom Penh. At 09:00 the Supreme Committee had its first session and unanimously elected Sak Sutsakhan president, becoming both the head of the government and interim Chief of State. Sak decided to make a last peace offer to Prince Sihanouk, transferring the Republic and its armed forces to him, but not surrendering to the Khmer Rouge. Late that night Sak called a meeting of the Council of Ministers, this time consisting of both the Supreme Committee and the Cabinet, made decisions including certain political and military measures, channeling the ever increasing stream of refugees into schools, pagodas, their feeding, the reshuffling of the cabinet, reinforcing the troops in Phnom Penh by flying in a few battalions from different provinces through the Mean Chey airport and the formation of an Ad Hoc Committee chaired by Long Boret to prepare peace overtures for either Prince Sihanouk or the Khmer Rouge.On 14 April the military situation was becoming increasingly precarious. That morning the Cabinet met at Sak's office at the General Staff Headquarters (11.567\u00b0N 104.925\u00b0E\ufeff / 11.567; 104.925). At 10:25 a KAF pilot dropped four 250-pound bombs from his T-28 fighter bomber. Two of the bombs exploded about 20 yards (18 m) from Sak's office killing seven officers and NCOs and wounded twenty others. Sak declared a 24-hour curfew and that the battle would continue. That afternoon Takhmau, the capital of Kandal Province, 11 kilometres (6.8 mi) south of Phnom Penh fell to the Khmer Rouge. The loss of this town, a key point in the FANK defense perimeter, had a demoralizing effect. Several counterattacks were initiated but to no avail. Soon a fierce battle was in progress in the southern suburbs. The U.S. aerial resupply into Pochentong was completely halted.The 15th began with the Khmer Rouge pressing in from north and west. Pochentong and the dike running east/west to the north of Phnom Penh, both of which formed the last ring of defense around the capital, were overrun by Khmer Rouge assaults. The intervention of the Parachute Brigade, brought back from the east of the Mekong, had no effect on the situation to the west of the capital. The brigade tried to move west, but was only able to get 6 kilometres (3.7 mi) down Route 4. Meanwhile, refugees continued to pour into the city.\n\nOn 16 April, the morning Cabinet meeting was devoted entirely to the mechanics of sending a peace offer to Peking as quickly as possible. Long Boret drafted the offer calling for an immediate ceasefire and a transfer of power to FUNK. The offer was sent to Peking via the Red Cross and the Agence France-Presse. The military situation was becoming worse, the Shell oil depot (11.607\u00b0N 104.917\u00b0E\ufeff / 11.607; 104.917) north of the city was set ablaze by gunfire, while fire swept shacks to the south of the city. All afternoon the Cabinet waited for the answer from Peking. By 23:00 an answer had still not arrived and the Cabinet realized that the Khmer Rouge did not want to accept the offer. Meanwhile, the Khmer Rouge had occupied the east bank of the Mekong following the withdrawal of the Parachute Brigade, while General Dien Del\u2019s 2nd Division held the Monivong Bridge.KAF T-28Ds flew their last combat sortie by bombing the KAF control centre and hangars at Pochentong upon its capture by the Khmer Rouge. After virtually expending their ordnance reserves, 97 KAF aircraft escaped from airbases and auxiliary airfields throughout Cambodia, with a small number of civilian dependents on board, to safe havens in neighbouring Thailand.\n\n\n=== 17 April ===\n\nAt 02:00 on 17 April the Cabinet agreed that, as its peace offer had not been accepted, it would move the Cabinet, the Supreme Committee and even members of the Assembly from Phnom Penh to the north to the capital of Oddar Meanchey Province on the Thai border in order to continue resistance from there. The only way to leave the capital was by helicopter. At 04:00 the members of the Government met in the garden in front of the Wat Botum Vaddey (11.559\u00b0N 104.932\u00b0E\ufeff / 11.559; 104.932) for evacuation, but the helicopters did not show up. Dawn was breaking over the eastern horizon. The Government members returned to Premier Long Boret's house at 05:30 and decided to resist to the death in Phnom Penh itself. After 06:00, the Minister of Information, Thong Lim Huong, brought a cable just arrived from Peking advising that the peace appeal had been rejected by Sihanouk. At the same time they branded the seven members of the Supreme Committee as chief traitors, in addition to the seven who had taken power in 1970.Heavy fighting had been taking place since 04:00 in the north of the city around the main power station (11.59\u00b0N 104.915\u00b0E\ufeff / 11.59; 104.915). By dawn the firing ceased as the FANK forces gave way to the Khmer Rouge and retreated along Monivong Boulevard into the city center. Admiral Vong Sarendy had returned to the naval base which was under attack by the Khmer Rouge. He called Sak later advising that the base was surrounded and about to be overrun. As Khmer Rouge forces entered the command post Sarendy committed suicide.By 08:00 the rest of the Cabinet, the deputies and the senators left the session, leaving Long Boret and Sak. General Thach Reng arrived to plead with them to leave with him, as he still had his men of the Special Forces and seven UH-1 helicopters at his disposal at the Olympic Stadium. At approximately 08:30 Sak and his family boarded a helicopter and were flown out, as was KAF commander Ea Chhong. Meanwhile, Long Boret boarded another helicopter which failed to take off. Four helicopters flew to Kampong Thom to refuel, arriving at 09:30. Establishing radio contact with Phnom Penh, Sak learned that the Khmer Rouge had penetrated into the General Staff Headquarters. General Mey Sichan addressed the nation and the troops in Sak's name asking them to hoist the white flag as a sign of peace. Sak's helicopter arrived at Oddar Meanchey at 13:30, as the collapse of the Republic was imminent. Any chance of reestablishing the Government evaporated and the assembled officers decided to seek exile in Thailand.As the Khmer Rouge entered the capital, a small group of soldiers and armed students, styled as the MONATIO and led by Hem Keth Dara, began driving around the city welcoming the arrival of the Khmer Rouge. MONATIO was apparently a creation of Lon Non, in an attempt to share power with the Khmer Rouge. Initially tolerated by the Khmer Rouge, MONATIO members were later rounded up and executed.Several hours later the Khmer Rouge began entering central Phnom Penh from all directions and stationed themselves at the major crossroads where they disarmed FANK soldiers and collected weapons. The disarmed soldiers were then marched to the Olympic Stadium where they were later executed. The Khmer Rouge held a press conference at the Ministry of Information where a number of prisoners, including Lon Non and Hem Keth Dara, were being held. A car carrying Long Boret arrived and he joined the prisoners.After midday the Khmer Rouge ordered the evacuation of the city for three days, evicting expatriates and Cambodians from the Hotel Le Phnom which the Red Cross had sought to establish as a neutral zone, and emptying the city's hospitals which contained approximately 20,000 wounded who were unlikely to survive the walk to the countryside. Approximately 800 expatriates and 600 Cambodians took refuge at the French Embassy (11.583\u00b0N 104.916\u00b0E\ufeff / 11.583; 104.916). At this time the Khmer Rouge military numbered only 68,000, with a further 14,000 party members. Elizabeth Becker asserts that lacking the numbers necessary to openly control Cambodia, emptying Phnom Penh of those of its population who were indifferent or openly hostile to them was essential for securing Khmer Rouge control.Koy Thuon, a Khmer Rouge deputy front commander, organized the \"Committee for Wiping Out Enemies\" at the Hotel Monorom (11.57\u00b0N 104.918\u00b0E\ufeff / 11.57; 104.918). Its first action was to order the immediate execution of Lon Nol and other leading government figures. Captured FANK officers were taken to the Hotel Monoram to write their biographies and then to the Olympic Stadium, where they were executed.\n\n\n== Aftermath ==\nOn the morning of 18 April, Sak and the remaining members of the Khmer Republic Government and assorted military personnel boarded a KAF C-123 and flew to U-Tapao and into exile. The same day the Khmer Rouge ordered all Cambodians in the French Embassy, other than women married to Frenchmen, to leave the Embassy or they would take it over; they rejected any right of asylum. Among those evicted was Prince Sisowath Sirik Matak, one of those responsible for the removal of Sihanouk from power in 1970 and who had been branded one of the seven original traitors marked for execution by the FUNK. Also evicted were Princess Mam Manivan Phanivong, one of Sihanouk's wives; Khy-Taing Lim, the Minister of Finance; and Loeung Nal, the Minister of Health.Long Boret was executed on the grounds of the Cercle Sportif in Phnom Penh (ironically now the location of the US Embassy) on or about 21 April. Khmer Rouge Radio subsequently reported that he had been beheaded but other reports indicate that he and Sisowath Sirik Matak were executed by firing squad or that he was shot in the kidney and left to suffer a slow death, while his family were executed by machine gun fire.Pol Pot arrived in a deserted Phnom Penh on 23 April. On 30 April the occupants of the French Embassy were loaded onto trucks and driven to the Thai border arriving four days later.The collapse of the Khmer Republic following the Fall of Phnom Penh allowed the Khmer Rouge to consolidate their control over Cambodia and begin the implementation of their agrarian socialism.

'City of the Brahma's Faces') or shortly known as Krong Chaktomuk (Khmer: \u1780\u17d2\u179a\u17bb\u1784\u1785\u178f\u17bb\u1798\u17bb\u1781), is the capital and most populous city in Cambodia. Phnom Penh has been the national capital since French colonization of Cambodia, and has grown to become the nation's economic, industrial, and cultural center.\nOnce known as the \"Pearl of Asia,\" it was considered one of the loveliest French-built cities in Indochina in the 1920s. Phnom Penh, along with Siem Reap and Sihanoukville, are significant global and domestic tourist destinations for Cambodia. Founded in 1372, the city is noted for its historical architecture and attractions. It became the national capital in 1434 following the fall of Angkor, and remained so until 1497. It regained its capital status during the French colonial era in 1865. There are a number of surviving French colonial buildings scattered along the grand boulevards.\nOn the banks of the Tonl\u00e9 Sap, Mekong, and Bassac Rivers, Phnom Penh is home to more than 2 million people, approximately 14% of the Cambodian population.\n\n\n== Etymology ==\nPhnom Penh (literally, 'Penh's Hill') takes its name from the present Wat Phnom ('Hill Temple'). Legend has it that in 1372, a wealthy widow named Lady Penh found a Koki tree floating down the Tonle Sap river after a storm. Inside the tree were four bronze Buddha statues and a stone statue of Vishnu. Daun Penh ordered villagers to raise the height of the hill northeast of her house and used the Koki wood to build a temple on the hill to house the four Buddha statues, and a shrine for the Vishnu image slightly lower down. The temple became known as Wat Phnom Daun Penh, which is now known as Wat Phnom, a small hill 27 metres (89 ft) in height.\nPhnom Penh's official name, in its short form, is Krong Chaktomok (Khmer: \u1780\u17d2\u179a\u17bb\u1784\u1785\u178f\u17bb\u1798\u17bb\u1781) meaning \"City of Four Faces\".

This loosely translates as \"The place of four rivers that gives the happiness and success of Khmer Kingdom, the highest leader as well as impregnable city of the God Indra of the great kingdom\".\n\n\n== History ==\nFirst recorded a century after it is said to have taken place, the legend of the founding of Phnom Penh tells of a local woman, Penh (commonly referred to as Daun Penh (\"Grandmother Penh\" or \"Old Lady Penh\") in Khmer), living at Chaktomuk, the future Phnom Penh. It was the late 14th century, and the Khmer capital was still at Angkor near Siem Reap 350 km (217 mi) to the north. Gathering firewood along the banks of the river, Lady Penh spied a floating koki tree in the river and fished it from the water. Inside the tree she found four Buddha statues and one of Vishnu.\nThe discovery was taken as a divine blessing, and to some a sign that the Khmer capital was to be brought to Phnom Penh from Angkor. To house the new-found sacred objects, Penh raised a small hill on the west bank of the Tonle Sap River and crowned it with a shrine, now known as Wat Phnom at the north end of central Phnom Penh. \"Phnom\" is Khmer for \"hill\" and Penh's hill took on the name of the founder, and the area around it became known after the hill.\nPhnom Penh first became the capital of Cambodia after Ponhea Yat, king of the Khmer Empire, moved the capital from Angkor Thom after it was captured and destroyed by Siam a few years earlier. There is a stupa behind Wat Phnom that houses the remains of Ponhea Yat and the royal family as well as the remaining Buddhist statues from the Angkorean era. In the 17th century, Japanese immigrants also settled on the outskirts of present-day Phnom Penh. A small Portuguese community survived in Phnom Penh until the 17th century, undertaking commercial and religious activity in the country.\nPhnom Penh remained the royal capital for 73 years, from 1432 to 1505. It was abandoned for 360 years (from 1505 to 1865) by subsequent kings due to internal fighting between the royal pretenders. Later kings moved the capital several times and established their royal capitals at various locations in Tuol Basan (Srey Santhor), Pursat, Longvek, Lavear Em and Oudong.\nIt was not until 1866, under the reign of King Norodom I (1860\u20131904), the eldest son of King Ang Duong, who ruled on behalf of Siam, that Phnom Penh became the permanent seat of government and capital of Cambodia, and also where the current Royal Palace was built. Beginning in 1870, the French colonial authorities turned a riverside village into a city where they built hotels, schools, prisons, barracks, banks, public works offices, telegraph offices, law courts, and health services buildings. In 1872, the first glimpse of a modern city took shape when the colonial administration employed the services of French contractor Le Faucheur to construct the first 300 concrete houses for sale and rental to Chinese traders.\nBy the 1920s, Phnom Penh was known as the \"Pearl of Asia\", and over the next four decades, Phnom Penh continued to experience rapid growth with the building of railways to Sihanoukville and Pochentong International Airport (now Phnom Penh International Airport). Phnom Penh's infrastructure saw major modernisation under the rule of Sihanouk.During the Vietnam War, Cambodia was used as a base by the People's Army of Vietnam (PAVN) and the Viet Cong (VC) and thousands of refugees from across the country flooded the city to escape the fighting between their own government troops, the PAVN/VC, the South Vietnamese and its allies and the Khmer Rouge and the American air strikes. By 1975, the population was 2\u20133 million, the bulk of whom were refugees from the fighting. The Khmer Rouge cut off supplies to the city for more than a year before it fell on April 17, 1975. Reports from journalists stated that the Khmer Rouge shelling \"tortured the capital almost continuously,\" inflicting \"random death and mutilation\" on millions of trapped civilians. The Khmer Rouge forcibly evacuated the entire city after taking it, in what has been described as a death march: Fran\u00e7ois Ponchaud wrote that \"I shall never forget one cripple who had neither hands nor feet, writhing along the ground like a severed worm, or a weeping father carrying his ten-year old daughter wrapped in a sheet tied around his neck like a sling, or the man with his foot dangling at the end of a leg to which it was attached by nothing but skin\"; Jon Swain recalled that the Khmer Rouge were \"tipping out patients from the hospitals like garbage into the streets....In five years of war, this is the greatest caravan of human misery I have seen.\" All of its residents, including the wealthy and educated, were evacuated from the city and forced to do difficult labour on rural farms as \"new people\". Tuol Sleng High School was taken over by Pol Pot's forces and was turned into the S-21 prison camp, where people were detained and tortured. Pol Pot sought a return to an agrarian economy and therefore killed many people perceived as educated, \"lazy\" or political enemies. Many others starved to death as a result of failure of the agrarian society and the sale of Cambodia's rice to China in exchange for bullets and weaponry. The former high school is now the Tuol Sleng Genocide Museum, where Khmer Rouge torture devices and photos of their victims are displayed. Choeung Ek (The Killing Fields), 15 kilometers (9 mi) away, where the Khmer Rouge marched prisoners from Tuol Sleng to be murdered and buried in shallow pits, is also now a memorial to those who were killed by the regime.\nThe Khmer Rouge were driven out of Phnom Penh by the PAVN in 1979, and people began to return to the city. Vietnam is historically a state with which Cambodia has had many conflicts, therefore this liberation was and is viewed with mixed emotions by the Cambodians. A period of reconstruction began, spurred by the continuing stability of government, attracting new foreign investment and aid by countries including France, Australia, and Japan. Loans were made from the Asian Development Bank and the World Bank to reinstate a clean water supply, roads and other infrastructure. The 1998 Census put Phnom Penh's population at 862,000; and the 2008 census was 1.3 million.\n\n\n== Geography ==\nPhnom Penh is in the south-central region of Cambodia, and is fully surrounded by Kandal Province. The municipality is on the banks of the Tonl\u00e9 Sap, Mekong, and Bassac Rivers. These rivers provide freshwater and other natural resources to the city. Phnom Penh and the surrounding areas consist of a typical flood plain area for Cambodia. Although Phnom Penh is at 11.89 metres (39 ft) above the river, monsoon season flooding is a problem, and the river sometimes overflows its banks.\nThe city, at 11.55\u00b0N 104.91667\u00b0E\ufeff / 11.55; 104.91667 (11\u00b033' North, 104\u00b055' East), covers an area of 678.46 square kilometres (262 sq mi), with some 11,401 hectares (28,172 acres) in the municipality and 26,106 ha (64,509 acres) of roads. The agricultural land in the municipality amounts to 34.685 km2 (13 sq mi) with some 1.476 km2 (365 acres) under irrigation.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nPhnom Penh has a tropical wet and dry climate (K\u00f6ppen climate classification Aw). The climate is hot year-round with only minor variations. Temperatures typically range from 22 to 35 \u00b0C (72 to 95 \u00b0F) and weather is subject to the tropical monsoons. The southwest monsoon blows inland bringing moisture-laden winds from the Gulf of Thailand and Indian Ocean from May to November. The northeast monsoon ushers in the dry season, which lasts from December to April. The city experiences the heaviest precipitation from September to October with the driest period in January and February.\nThe city has two distinct seasons. The rainy season, which runs from May to November, sees high temperatures accompanied by high humidity. The dry season lasts from December to April; when overnight temperatures can drop to 22 \u00b0C (72 \u00b0F).\n\n\n== Administration ==\n\nPhnom Penh is a municipality of area 678.46 square kilometres (261.95 sq mi) with a government status equal to that of Cambodian provinces. The municipality is divided into 14 administrative divisions called khans (sections). The sections are subdivided into 105 sangkats (quarters), and further subdivided into 953 phums (villages).  All khans are under the governance of the Phnom Penh Municipality. Dangkao, Meanchey, Porsenchey, Sen Sok and Russei Keo are considered the outskirts of the city.\nThe municipality is governed by the governor who acts as the top executive of the city as well as overseeing the Municipal Military Police, Municipal Police, and Bureau of Urban Affairs. Below the governor is the first vice governor and five vice governors. The chief of cabinet, who holds the same status as the vice governors, heads the cabinet consisting of eight deputy chiefs of cabinet who in turn are in charge of the 27 administrative departments. Every khan (district) also has a chief.\n\n\n== Demographics ==\nAs of 2019, Phnom Penh had a population of 2,129,371 people, with a total population density of 3,136 inhabitants per square kilometre in a 679 square kilometres (262 sq mi) city area. The population growth rate of the city is 3.92%. The city area has grown fourfold since 1979, and the metro area will continue to expand in order to support the city's growing population and economy.\nPhnom Penh is mostly inhabited by Cambodians (or Khmers). They represent 90% of the population of the city. There are large minorities of Chinese, Vietnamese, and other small ethnic groups who are Thai, Budong, Mnong Preh, Kuy, Chong, and Chams. The state religion is Theravada Buddhism. More than 90% of the people in Phnom Penh are Buddhists. Chams have been practicing Islam for hundreds of years. Since 1993, there has also been an increase in the practice of Christianity which was practically wiped out after 1975 when the Khmer Rouge took over. The official language is Khmer, but English and French are widely used in the city.\nThe number of slum-inhabitants at the end of 2012 was 105,771, compared with 85,807 at the start of 2012.Note: As stated in the \"History\" paragraph (The 1998 Census put Phnom Penh's population at 862,000; and the 2008 census was 1.3 million.) the information collides with the information provided in the \"Historical population\" table. Needs editing.\n\n\n== Politics ==\n\n \nPhnom Penh is allocated 12 seats in the National Assembly, making it the largest constituency.\n\n\n=== Members of Parliament ===\n\n\n== Economy ==\n\nPhnom Penh is Cambodia's economic centre as it accounts for a large portion of the Cambodian economy. Double-digit economic growth rates in recent years have triggered an economic boom in Phnom Penh, with new hotels, restaurants, schools, bars, high rises and residential buildings springing up in the city.\nThe economy is based on commercial interests such as garments, trading, and small and medium enterprises. In the past few years the property business has been booming, with rapidly increasing real estate prices. Tourism is also a major contributor in the capital as more shopping and commercial centres open, making Phnom Penh one of the major tourist destinations in South East Asia along with Siem Reap and Sihanoukville. According to the World Travel and Tourism Council, tourism made up 19.2 percent (US$2,053 million) of Cambodia's GDP in 2009 and accounts for 13.7 percent of total employment. One of the most popular areas in Phnom Penh for tourists is Sisowath Quay, alongside the Tonle Sap River. Sisowath Quay is a five kilometre strip of road that includes restaurants, bars, and hotels.The US$2.6 billion new urban development, Camko City, is meant to bolster the city landscape. The Bureau of Urban Affairs of Pnochina Penh Municipality has plans to expand and construct new infrastructure to accommodate the growing population and economy. High rise buildings will be chinesely constructed at the entrance of the city and near the lakes and riverbanks. Furthermore, new roads, canals, and a railway system will be used to connect Camko City and Phnom Penh.\nOther projects include:\n\nGrand Phnom Penh International City (under construction)\nDe Castle Royal Condominium (Completed)\nGold Tower 42 (On hold 32 floors construction begins again in the mid of 2018)\nOCIC Tower (Completed)\nKokling super second floor house\nVattanac Capital Tower (completed)\nThe Bridge (Completed)\nThe Peak (under construction)\nWith booming economic growth seen since the 1990s, new shopping venues have opened: Sorya Center Point, Aeon Mall Phnom Penh, Aeon Mall Sen Sok City, Olympia Mall, and Parkson Mall (under construction). Many international brands have opened such as Mango, Salvatore Ferragamo, Hugo Boss, Padini Concept Store, Lily, Timberland, Jimmy Choo, CC Double O, MO, Brands Outlet, Nike, Converse, Pony, Armani Exchange, and Super Dry.\nThe tallest skyscraper in Phnom Penh is Vattanac Capital Tower at a height of 188 metres (617 ft), dominating Phnom Penh's skyline with its neighbour skyscraper Canadia Tower (OCIC Tower). The tower was completed in December 2014. Modern high rises have been constructed all around the city, not concentrated in any one particular area.\nThe Central Market Phsar Thmei is a tourist attraction. The four wings of the yellow colored market are teeming with numerous stalls selling gold and silver jewelry, antique coins, clothing, clocks, flowers, food, fabrics and shoes. Phsar Thmei is undergoing under a major renovation, along with the creation of newer stalls.\n\n\n== Education ==\n\n\n=== Universities and colleges ===\n\n\n=== Primary and secondary schools ===\n\n\n=== International schools ===\n\n\n=== Supplementary and extra schools ===\nThe Japanese Supplementary School of Phnom Penh , formerly known in English as the Phnom Penh Japanese School, is a part-time Japanese School, operated by the Japanese Association of Cambodia (JACAM;\u30ab\u30f3\u30dc\u30b8\u30a2\u65e5\u672c\u4eba\u4f1a Kambojia Nihonjin-kai). It is in Sangkat Toek Thla in Sen Sok. It was established in 2002. It had 60 students in June 2011.\n\n\n== Culture ==\nPhnom Penh also has its own dialect of Khmer. Speakers of the Phnom Penh dialect often elide syllables, which has earned it the reputation for being lazy speech. Phnom Penh is also known for its influence on New Khmer Architecture. Phnom Penh is notable for Ka tieu Phnom Penh, its variation on rice noodle soup, a dish available in sit-down cafes as well as street cafes.\nMusic and the arts are making a revival throughout Cambodia, especially in Phnom Penh. Phnom Penh currently hosts a number of music events throughout the city. 'Indie' bands (those without corporate sponsors) have grown in number due also in part to the emergence of private music schools such as SoundsKool Music (also operating in the city of Siem Reap), and Music Arts School (registered as an NGO).\nThe two most visited museums in the city are the National Museum, which is the country's leading historical and archaeological museum, and Tuol Sleng Genocide Museum, a former Khmer Rouge prison. The National Museum hosts celebrations of Cambodian dance and music, including a popular classic Apsara dance show of traditional folk dances as well as original creations.\nChaul Chnam Thmey April 13\u201315\n\nAt this time, Phnom Penh celebrates Cambodian New Year, an occasion increasingly popular with tourists. During this typically hottest part of the year, water gets thrown around adding to the party atmosphere along with dancing and music. The precise date changes year-by-year but this holiday lasts, at least, three days. This festival marks the turn of the year based on the ancient Khmer calendar and also marks the end of the prior year harvest.\nWater Festival November\n\nThe largest annual festival in Phnom Penh, this lively gathering celebrates the reversing of the flow of the Tonl\u00e9 Sap River. The holiday lasts three days as people flood into the city to enjoy the fireworks, boat races, live concerts, eating and partying. The boat racing dates back to ancient times marking the strengths of the Khmer marine forces during the Khmer Empire.\nOn 22 November 2010 at least 348 people were crushed to death in a bridge stampede at the festival.Pchum Ben October 11\u201315 (2012)\nPchum Ben is a very important aspect of Cambodian culture. It may be translated as \"gathering together\" to make offerings and is a time of reunion, commemoration, express love and appreciation for one's ancestors. By offering food and good karma to those possibly trapped in the spirit world, living relatives help assuage their misery and guide them back into the cycle of reincarnation.\nVisak Bochea May\n\nVes\u0101kha is an annual holiday observed traditionally by Buddhists in Cambodia. Sometimes informally called \"Buddha's Birthday\", it actually encompasses the birth, enlightenment (nirv\u0101\u1e47a), and passing away (Parinirv\u0101na) of Gautama Buddha.\n\n\n== Cityscape and architecture ==\n\nThe oldest structure is Wat Phnom from the founding days of the city, constructed in 1373. The main tourist attractions are the Royal Palace with the Silver Pagoda, and the National Museum, constructed during the French colonial era in the late-19th century in the classical Khmer style and hosting a vast collection of Khmer antiquities. The Independence Monument (Khmer: Vimean Akareach), although from the 1950s, is also constructed in the ancient Khmer style.\nThe French, who were the colonial masters from the 19th century to the 1940s, also left their mark, with various colonial villas, French churches, boulevards, and the Art Deco market Phsar Thom Thmei. A notable landmark of the colonial era is the Hotel Le Royal.\n\nStarting with independence from the French in the 1950s and lasting until the era of the Khmer Rouge in the 1970s, Phnom Penh underwent tremendous growth as the capital city of a newly independent country. King Sihanouk was eager to present a new style of architecture and thus invigorate the process of nation building. A new golden era of architecture took off, with various projects and young Khmer architects, often educated in France, given opportunities to design and construct. This new movement was called \"New Khmer Architecture\" and was often characterised by a fusion of Bauhaus, European post-modern architecture, and traditional elements from Angkor. The most prominent architect was Vann Molyvann, who was nominated chief national architect by the king himself in 1956. Molyvann created landmark buildings such as the Preah Suramarit National Theatre and the Council of Ministers building. Other architects helped construct the newly founded Royal Khmer University, the Institute of Foreign Languages, and the National Sports Centre. With the growth of the upper and entrepreneurial middle classes, new suburbs were built in the 1950s and 1960s. Although these buildings survived the Khmer Rouge era and the civil war, today they are under threat due to economic development and financial speculation. Villas and gardens from that era are being destroyed and redeveloped to make place for bigger structures. The landmark National Theatre by Molyvann was razed in 2008. A movement is rising in Cambodia to preserve this modernist heritage. Old villas are sometimes being converted into boutique hotels, such as the Knai Bang Chatt. \nMonuments and memorials to the genocide of the Khmer Rouge era in the 1970s are the Tuol Sleng Genocide Museum (a former high school used as a concentration camp) and, on the outskirts of the city, the Choeung Ek Genocide Center. The Cambodia-Vietnam Friendship Monument was commissioned by the Vietnamese communists as symbol of Khmer-Vietnamese friendship during the late-1970s following the liberation of Cambodia from the Khmer Rouge.\nThe population, foreign investment, and urban development in Phnom Penh grew dramatically during the 1990s and early-2000s. The rapid growth resulted in the city's infrastructure distinctly lacking (the drainage system is particularly notorious, and Phnom Penh frequently floods during the wet season), and a need for both residential and commercial spaces. The simultaneous demand for residential and commercial housing and the increase of international investment has led to the planning, if not construction, of several satellite cities. The largest of these cities are: Grand Phnom Penh International City, CamKo City, Diamond Island City, Boeung Kak Town, and Chruy Cangva City.\nOn the outskirts of the city, farmland has been developed into garment factories and housing for lower economic classes and those displaced by the new development in the city center.\n\n\n=== 2035 master plan ===\nOriginally intended to be completed by 2020, the 2035 master plan is a French-funded project for the development of Phnom Penh. Although the plan was approved by the Ministry of Land Management, Urban Planning and Construction in 2005, it has yet to be ratified by the Cabinet of Cambodia. The original plan details five edge-city projects connected to the historical city centre by waterways and tree-lined corridors.\n\n\n== Media ==\n\n\n=== Dailies ===\n\n\n==== Khmer ====\nSralagn' Khmer (Love Khmer)\nChakraval Daily (Universe)\nKampuchea Thmei Daily (New Cambodia)\nKampuchea Tgnai Nis (Cambodia Today)\nKanychok Sangkhum (Social Reflection)\nKoh Santepheap (Island of Peace)\nMoneaksekar Khmer (Khmer Conscience) \u2013 Published by the Sam Rainsy Party.\nRasmei Kampuchea (Light of Kampuchea) \u2013 Cambodia's largest daily, it circulates about 18,000 copies.\nSamleng Yuvachun (Voice of Khmer Youth)\nUdomkate Khmer (Khmer Ideal)\nWat Phnom Daily (Mount Temple)\n\n\n==== English ====\nPhnom Penh Post, a daily English-language newspaper published in Phnom Penh.\nThe Cambodia Daily, an English-language daily newspaper (closed in 2017).\nThe Khmer Times, an English-language daily newspaper.\n\n\n==== Chinese ====\n\u300a\u67ec\u83ef\u65e5\u5831\u300b(Jianhua Daily), a daily Chinese-language newspaper published in Phnom Penh.\n\u300a\u661f\u6d32\u65e5\u5831\u300b(Sin Chew Daily), a Chinese-language daily newspaper, the Cambodian edition of the Malaysian Chinese daily of the same name.\n\u300a\u83ef\u5546\u65e5\u5831\u300b(Huashang Daily), a Chinese-language daily newspaper.\n\u300a\u9ad8\u68c9\u65e5\u62a5\u300b(Khmer Daily), a Chinese-language daily newspaper.\n\u300a\u65b0\u67ec\u57d4\u5be8\u300b(New Cambodia), a Chinese-language daily newspaper.\n\n\n=== Magazines ===\nAsiaLIFE Guide Phnom Penh, a monthly English-language lifestyle magazine published in Phnom Penh.\nPocket Guide Cambodia publishes four separate guides aimed at English-speaking residents and visitors.\nF Magazine, the first fashion-forward magazine in Cambodia.

Cambodia has increasingly become involved in modern sports over the last 30 years. As with the rest of the country, football and the martial arts are particularly popular.  Ultimate fighting and freestyle boxing have also become more common in recent years.The most prominent sporting venue in the city is the Phnom Penh National Olympic Stadium with a capacity of 80,000\u2014although the country never hosted the Olympic Games due to disruption by the civil war and the Khmer Rouge in the 1970s. Built in 1964, it is home to the Cambodian national football team. On completion the stadium was one of the largest in Asia. Today it is the 6th largest stadium in Southeast Asia. Volleyball, basketball, and Tai-Kwon-Do games are often hosted at the stadium.  The stadium closed in 2000, but was redeveloped and reopened.\nThe National Sports Centre of Cambodia hosts swimming, boxing, and volleyball competitions. Noted local football clubs include Phnom Penh Empire, Khemara Keila FC and Military Police.\n\n\n== Transport ==\n\nPhnom Penh International Airport is the largest and busiest airport in Cambodia. It is seven kilometres west of central Phnom Penh. The airport is connected to the city center by taxi, train, and shuttle bus.\nCambodia's national flag carrier, Cambodia Angkor Air, launched in 2009, is headquartered in Phnom Penh and has its main hub there, with an additional hub at the Angkor International Airport.Air France used to serve Phnom Penh from Paris-Charles de Gaulle but this service has since stopped. Qatar Airways now flies to and from Phnom Penh, via Ho Chi Minh City.\nTaxis, pick-ups, and minibuses leave the city for destinations all over the country, but are fast losing ground to cheaper and more comfortable buses. Phnom Penh also has a rail service.\nThere are numerous bus companies, including Phnom Penh Public Transport and GST Express, running services to most provincial capitals, including Sihanoukville, Kampong Chhnang, Oudong and Tak\u00e9o. Phnom Penh Sorya Transport Co. offers bus service to several provincial destinations along the National Routes and to Ho Chi Minh City. Giant Ibis is another bus company based in Phnom Penh, which travels to Sihanoukville, Kampot, Siem Reap and Ho Chi Minh, and has free Wi-Fi, air conditioning and modest pricing.\nThe city is Cambodia's main freshwater port, a major port on the Mekong River. It is linked to the South China Sea, 290 kilometres distant, via a channel of the Mekong in Vietnam.\n\n\n=== Public transport ===\n\nPhnom Penh is served by three air conditioned bus lines. Initial attempts by the Japanese government to develop a Phnom Penh bus service began in 2001. An update of the JICA urban transport master plan for Phnom Penh was completed and implemented in 2014. The city is now served by three bus lines, operated by the Phnom Penh municipal government. Private transportation within the city include the cycle rickshaw, known in Khmer as \"cyclo\", the motorcycle taxi known in Khmer as \"moto\", the auto rickshaw known locally as \"tuk-tuk\", the trailer attached to a motorcycle taxi known in Khmer as \"remorque\", and the standard automobile taxicab known in Khmer as \"taxi\". Private forms of transportation used by locals include bicycles, motorbikes, and cars.\n\n\n=== Highways ===\n\nAs the capital of Cambodia, a number of national highways connect the city with various parts of the country:\n\n\n== Water supply ==\n\nWater supply in Phnom Penh has improved dramatically in terms of access, service quality, efficiency, cost recovery and governance between 1993 and 2006. The number of customers has increased ninefold, service quality has improved from intermittent to continuous supply, water losses have been cut dramatically and the city's water utility went from being bankrupt to making a modest profit. These achievements were recognized through international awards such as the 2006 Ramon Magsaysay Award and the 2010 Stockholm Industry Water Award. The city's water utility is the Phnom Penh Water Supply Authority (PPWSA). Its main water sources are the Mekong River, the Tonle Sap river and the Tonle Bassac river.\n\n\n== International relations ==\n\n\n=== Twin towns and sister cities ===\nPhnom Penh is twinned with:\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of markets in Phnom Penh\nSpecial Economic Zones of Cambodia\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\nGroslier, B.P.

          "Really nice show! I really would advise you to see it if you are in the city. Regarding the different prices, we had the most expensive one with the 2 pillows, you rather take it because it\u2019s very uncomfortable without during an hour.",
          "We absolutely loved this evening watching the ancient cultural dance routines performed by Cambodians trying to spread art and culture around Cambodia. It is an outdoor event so please have your mosquito repellent on. We loved every moment. A great way to spend an evening.",

          "Fantastic traditional show. A good activity for a solo traveller at night. Three tiers of seating prices, I selected section C for $15. View is still good for those who are being cost conscious. Talented dancers who obviously enjoy what they do.",
          "Brilliant! Went to 3 different shows and several rehearsals. Got to know staff, volunteers, choreographers and musicians. Exuberance and enthusiasm abounds. A true rediscovering of traditional Khmer arts after such a brutal period. Wonderful show!",
          "As with all other reviewers, myself, my wife and my 20 year old son all thoroughly enjoyed this show and highly recommend it. However, we were extremely disappointed with the after show meal at The Friends Restaurant across the road which I had chosen to include as a package",

          "We paid $15US each. The performance was for 1 hr and was great- the costumes and dancing were wonderful. Would highly recommend. You can also have dinner first at the \u201cfriends\u201d restaurant around the corner (which trains disadvantaged youth in workplace skills).",

          "In addition to all these great reviews, I'll add that there was variety in the dances performed. In fact, there are various themes for the evenings. (3 at the time I went - which you see depends on which day of the week.) The discipline and precision of the dancers was",

          "This show is high calibre music and dance at its best. The costumes are stunning. To know that cultural performance was all but wiped out during the rule of the khmer rouge makes a show like this truly meaningful. How wonderful that a revival is happening! Well worth supporting!",

        "wiki": "Phnom Tamao Wildlife Rescue Centre (PTWRC) is a wildlife centre located roughly 25 miles (40 km) by road south of Phnom Penh, Cambodia. The centre was established in 1995 and with an area of over 6,000 acres of protected regenerating forest, this is the largest zoo in Cambodia. Since 2001, PTWRC has been run by the government institution of Cambodian Forestry Administration in partnership with an environmental non-profit organization called Wildlife Alliance. Wildlife Alliance animal husbandry specialists, veterinarians, and care takers assist in the feeding and care of animals and operations. PTWRC currently houses over 1,200 rescued animals from 102 species including endangered Asian elephants, tigers, Pileated gibbon, Siamese crocodile, Malayan sun bears, among many others.  Many of the species are listed as Endangered or Vulnerable by the International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN).\n\n\n== Rescued Animals at Phnom Tamao Sanctuary ==\nRescued animals at Phnom Tamao can be seen through general park admission, through the wildlife tours organized by Wildlife Alliance, Free the Bears, and independent tour operators.\n\n\n=== Bears ===\nPhnom Tamao is home to the world's largest group of rescued Malayan sun bears together with a number of Moon bears or Asiatic black bears. The bear sanctuary covers an area of over 10 hectares and is home to more than 130 rescued bears which have been supported by Free the Bears since 1997. The bear sanctuary contains a dedicated classroom for visiting school groups \"The Bear Den\", a visitor centre and number of education zones for general visitors \"The Bear Discovery Centre\" and \"The Bear Discovery Trail\", a children's play area \"The Home of the Wild Things\" and a dedicated research facility \"The Field Station\" for student researchers undertaking projects aimed at improving the welfare of captive bears or promoting conservation of wild bears. Visitors wishing to spend time helping with the care of the bears and seeing behind the scenes of the world's biggest sanctuary for the world's smallest bear can join either the one-day Bear Care Tour (http://www.freethebears.org/index.php/help-the-bears/bear-care-tour) or Free the Bears volunteer programme for longer stays of 1\u201312 weeks (http://www.freethebears.org/index.php/help-the-bears/volunteer)\n\n\n=== Elephants ===\nElephants at Phnom Tamao have been trained using gentle Positive Reinforcement or Target Training. This means that they will simply not receive their \u201creward\u201d (pieces of fruit or vegetables) if they do not follow the keeper's verbal command. It is often preferable to train captive elephants because they can then be handled more safely, which means their health can be checked and they can be better cared for.Chhouk The youngest male elephant at Phnom Tamao has a prosthetic leg. Chhouk was found wandering alone in the Srepok Wilderness Area in Mondulkiri with a serious leg injury, most likely caused by a snare. The Forestry Administration in cooperation with Wildlife Alliance brought him to PTWRC as he would have died left on his own. Once his foot healed, the Cambodian School of Prosthetics and Orthotics designed Chhouk a prosthetic leg to help him walk normally again. In order to change the prosthesis twice daily, Chhouk is trained with a positive reinforcement rewards-based system.Lucky The most charismatic elephant at Phnom Tamao, Lucky is the \"gentle giant\" who has been trained through rewards-based positive reinforcement to respond to 20 different words (in English and Khmer). Watching and interacting with Lucky has helped endear and engage visitors in the experience of the elephants.\n\n\n=== Tigers ===\nThe Cambodian Forestry Administration assisted by Wildlife Alliance confiscated 7 tigers in a sting operation in Phnom Penh in the year 2000. This was done to demonstrate that tigers could still be illegally purchased in Cambodia, despite the fact that there are now almost none left in the wild. One had been so severely beaten that she died of brain damage. The others were nursed backed to health, quickly responding to the care they received from Wildlife Alliance. The tigers are now kept in pairs in their large, forested enclosures.\n\n\n== Rescue of Wildlife throughout Cambodia ==\nAll of the animals living at PTWRC were confiscated from the illegal wildlife trade, victims of habitat loss, donated by a private owner, or rescued in a human-wildlife conflict situation. Most were rescued by the Wildlife Rapid Rescue Team, formed in 2001. The Wildlife Rapid Rescue Team has rescued more than 50,000 live animals and confiscated large quantities of animal parts and other contraband.The Wildlife Rapid Rescue Team (WRRT) was established in cooperation with Wildlife Alliance, Cambodia\u2019s Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fishery\u2019s Department of Forestry Administration and the Royal Gendarmerie Khmer. WRRT is a 14-member team composed of Forestry Administration officials and Military Police who are mandated to crack down on the illegal wildlife trade throughout Cambodia, tracking down poachers and traffickers, raiding restaurants, markets, and stores, and investigating trafficking networks in cities and along borders. WRRT is a unique law enforcement squad in Southeast Asia, being devoted solely to combating the illegal wildlife trade.WRRT receives tips from a covert informant network and from the nationwide public hotline number. When WRRT rescues live animals, those that are healthy and suited for the wild are immediately released in an appropriate habitat. Animals that cannot be released because of injuries or trauma are cared for by Wildlife Alliance's Care for Rescued Wildlife team at the Phnom Tamao Wildlife Rescue Center.While Wildlife Alliance provides capacity building with logistical and technical support to WRRT, WRRT also trains teams working for other organizations that are addressing the illegal wildlife trade, both in the manner in which they conduct operations and in animal handling skills. WRRT\u2019s skill in handling and caring for rescued wild animals is such that there are almost never any fatalities, despite the poor conditions in which most traded wildlife is found.In 2010 Wildlife Alliance worked with the Cambodian Government to implement ASEAN-WEN (Wildlife Enforcement\nNetwork) in which authorities work with their counterparts in the neighboring countries to try to stop the cross-border trade.\n\n\n== Illegal Wildlife Trade ==\nUntil 2001, Cambodia\u2019s most prominent markets openly displayed rare animals for purchase and wildlife meats were commonplace on restaurant menus. Today wildlife dishes are no longer available at 90% of restaurants in the nation\u2019s capital. Today the illegal wildlife trade is predominantly run by the same dangerous groups behind drug and weapons trafficking.When illegal traders are caught by the Wildlife Rapid Rescue Team (WRRT), their contraband and equipment are confiscated. Traders are handed over to the courts, who impose prison terms and fines. Fines can be considerable and amounts of money have risen steadily as officials realize the importance of implementing laws protecting wild animals. This acts as a great deterrent, which ultimately makes it unprofitable for traders to stay in business. The Wildlife Rapid Rescue Team is not a forest patrol unit but a task force with a nationwide mandate that deals with the illegal trade, usually conducted from towns and cities. It does not address subsistence hunting but mostly the lucrative business conducted by middle men, who sell live and dead wild animals to restaurants and medical stores or export wildlife for consumption in neighboring countries.\n\n\n== Release of Rescued Wildlife ==\nRescued animals that are deemed suitable for release into the wild are relocated to a Wildlife Rehabilitation Station (WRS) created by Wildlife Alliance in Koh Kong Province, Cambodia. Here the animals are moved to a forested enclosure within an appropriate area of habitat where they are to be released. They are cared for within the enclosure for many months in order to become familiar with the area and relearn their wild instinctual behavior. When the animals are ready for release, the door to the enclosure is left open and the animals are free to leave at will. Wildlife Alliance continues to provide hands-off assistance and supplementary food at the enclosure location for as long as necessary.Released animals are then monitored using various methods such as visual observation, track identification, camera traps, and radio telemetry to ensure release strategies are successful and the animals are able to survive. Animals are familiarized with their new habitat before release and given support as they grow comfortable with their new skills in the wild. Sun bears, binturong (\"bear cats\"), macaques, and birds are just a few of the animals that have begun the second phase of their life here. The priority for the Care for Rescued Wildlife Program is to continue developing and implementing rehabilitation and release programs for many of the rescued animals, while continuing to feed and care for the animals that need to call PTWRC home.\n\n\n== External links ==\nElephants in Phnom Tamao Wildlife Rescue Centre in Cambodia in the elephant database\n\n\n== References ==",

Its estimated length is 4,350 km (2,703 mi), and it drains an area of 795,000 km2 (307,000 sq mi), discharging 475 km3 (114 cu mi) of water annually.\nFrom the Tibetan Plateau the river runs through China, Myanmar, Laos, Thailand, Cambodia, and Vietnam. The extreme seasonal variations in flow and the presence of rapids and waterfalls in the Mekong make navigation difficult. Even so, the river is a major trade route between western China and Southeast Asia.\n\n\n== Names ==\nMekong is originally called Mae Nam Khong from a contracted form of Tai shortened to Mae Khong.

It flows through the Tibetan Autonomous Region and then southeast into Yunnan Province, and then the Three Parallel Rivers Area in the Hengduan Mountains, along with the Yangtze to its east and the Salween River (Nu Jiang in Chinese) to its west.\nThen the Mekong meets the China\u2013Myanmar border and flows about 10 kilometres (6.2 mi) along that border until it reaches the tripoint of China, Myanmar and Laos.  From there it flows southwest and forms the border of Myanmar and Laos for about 100 kilometres (62 mi) until it arrives at the tripoint of Myanmar, Laos, and Thailand. This is also the point of confluence between the Ruak River (which follows the Thai\u2013Myanmar border) and the Mekong. The area of this tripoint is sometimes termed the Golden Triangle, although the term also refers to the much larger area of those three countries that was notorious as a drug producing region.\nFrom the Golden Triangle tripoint, the Mekong turns southeast to briefly form the border of Laos with Thailand.\nKhon Pi Long is a series of rapids along a 1.6-kilometre section of the Mekong River dividing Chiang Rai and Bokeo Province in Laos. The name of the rapids means 'where the ghost lost its way'. It then turns east into the interior of Laos, flowing first east and then south for some 400 kilometres (250 mi) before meeting the border with Thailand again. Once more, it defines the Laos-Thailand border for some 850 kilometres (530 mi) as it flows first east, passing the capital of Laos, Vientiane, then turns south. A second time, the river leaves the border and flows east into Laos soon passing the city of Pakse. Thereafter, it turns and runs more or less directly south, crossing into Cambodia.\nAt Phnom Penh the river is joined on the right bank by the river and lake system the Tonl\u00e9 Sap. When the Mekong is low, the Tonle Sap is a tributary: water flows from the lake and river into the Mekong. When the Mekong floods, the flow reverses: the floodwaters of the Mekong flow up the Tonle Sap.\nImmediately after the Sap River joins the Mekong by Phnom Penh, the Bassac River branches off the right (west) bank. The Bassac River is the first and main distributary of the Mekong. This is the beginning of the Mekong Delta. The two rivers, the Bassac to the west and the Mekong to the east, enter Vietnam shortly after this. In Vietnam, the Bassac is called the H\u1eadu River (S\u00f4ng H\u1eadu or H\u1eadu Giang); the main, eastern, branch of the Mekong is called the Ti\u1ec1n River or Ti\u1ec1n Giang. In Vietnam, distributaries of the eastern (main, Mekong) branch include the M\u1ef9 Tho River, the Ba Lai River, the H\u00e0m Lu\u00f4ng River, and the C\u1ed5 Chi\u00ean River.\n\n\n== Drainage basin ==\n\nThe Mekong Basin can be divided into two parts: the \"upper Mekong basin\" in Tibet, and the \"lower Mekong basin\" from Yunnan downstream from China to the South China Sea. From the point where it rises to its mouth, the most precipitous drop in the Mekong occurs in the upper Mekong basin, a stretch of some 2,200 km (1,400 mi). Here, it drops 4,500 metres (14,800 ft) before it enters the lower basin where the borders of Thailand, Laos, China, and Myanmar come together in the Golden Triangle. Downstream from the Golden Triangle, the river flows for a further 2,600 km (1,600 mi) through Laos, Thailand, and Cambodia before entering the South China Sea via a complex delta system in Vietnam.\n\n\n=== Upper basin ===\nThe upper basin makes up 24% of the total area and contributes 15\u201320% of the water that flows into the Mekong River. The catchment here is steep and narrow. Soil erosion has been a major problem and approximately 50% of the sediment in the river comes from the upper basin.\nIn Yunnan Province in China, the river and its tributaries are confined by narrow, deep gorges. The tributary river systems in this part of the basin are small. Only 14 have catchment areas that exceed 1,000 km2 (390 sq mi), yet the greatest amount of loss of forest cover in the entire river system per square kilometer has occurred in this region due to heavy unchecked demand for natural resources. In the south of Yunnan, in Simao and Xishuangbanna Prefectures, the river changes as the valley opens out, the floodplain becomes wider, and the river becomes wider and slower.\n\n\n=== Lower basin ===\nMajor tributary systems develop in the lower basin. These systems can be separated into two groups: tributaries that contribute to the major wet season flows, and tributaries that drain low relief regions of lower rainfall. The first group are left bank tributaries that drain the high rainfall areas of Laos. The second group are those on the right bank, mainly the Mun and Chi Rivers, that drain a large part of northeast Thailand.\nLaos lies almost entirely within the lower Mekong basin. Its climate, landscape and land use are the major factors shaping the hydrology of the river. The mountainous landscape means that only 16% of the country is farmed under lowland terrace or upland shifting cultivation. With upland shifting agriculture (slash and burn), soils recover within 10 to 20 years but the vegetation does not. Shifting cultivation is common in the uplands of northern Laos and is reported to account for as much as 27% of the total land under rice cultivation. As elsewhere in the basin, forest cover has been steadily reduced during the last three decades by shifting agriculture and permanent agriculture. The cumulative impacts of these activities on the river regime have not been measured. However, the hydrological impacts of land cover changes induced by the Vietnam War were quantified in two sub-catchments of the lower Mekong River basin.Loss of forest cover in the Thai areas of the lower basin has been the highest of all the lower Mekong countries over the past 60 years. On the Khorat Plateau, which includes the Mun and Chi tributary systems, forest cover was reduced from 42% in 1961 to 13% in 1993. Although this part of northeast Thailand has an annual rainfall of more than 1,000 mm, a high evaporation rate means it is classified as a semi-arid region. Consequently, although the Mun and Chi basins drain 15% of the entire Mekong basin, they only contribute 6% of the average annual flow. Sandy and saline soils are the most common soil types, which makes much of the land unsuitable for wet rice cultivation. In spite of poor fertility, however, agriculture is intensive. Glutinous rice, maize, and cassava are the principal crops. Drought is by far the major hydrological hazard in this region.\n\nAs the Mekong enters Cambodia, over 95% of its flows have already joined the river. From here on downstream the terrain is flat and water levels rather than flow volumes determine the movement of water across the landscape. The seasonal cycle of changing water levels at Phnom Penh results in the unique \"flow reversal\" of water into and out of the Great Lake via the Tonle Sap River. Phnom Penh also marks the beginning of the delta system of the Mekong River. Here the mainstream begins to break up into an increasing number of branches.In Cambodia, wet rice is the main crop and is grown on the flood plains of the Tonle Sap, Mekong, and Bassac (the Mekong delta distributary known as the H\u1eadu in Vietnam) Rivers. More than half of Cambodia remains covered with mixed evergreen and deciduous broadleaf forest, but forest cover has decreased from 73% in 1973 to 63% in 1993. Here, the river landscape is flat. Small changes in water level determine the direction of water movement, including the large-scale reversal of flow into and out of the Tonle Sap basin from the Mekong River.\n\nThe Mekong delta in Vietnam is farmed intensively and has little natural vegetation left. Forest cover is less than 10%. In the Central Highlands of Vietnam, forest cover was reduced from over 95% in the 1950s to around 50% in the mid-1990s. Agricultural expansion and population pressure are the major reasons for land use and landscape change. Both drought and flood are common hazards in the Delta, which many people believe is the most sensitive to upstream hydrological change.\n\n\n=== Water flow along its course ===\nTable 1: Country share of Mekong River Basin (MRB) and water flows\nBy taking into account hydrological regimes, physiography land use, and existing, planned and potential resource developments, the Mekong is divided into six distinct reaches:\n\nReach 1: Lancang Jiang or Upper Mekong River in China. In this part of the river, the major source of water flowing into the river comes from melting snow on the Tibetan plateau. This volume of water is sometimes called the \"Yunnan component\" and plays an important role in the low-flow hydrology of the lower mainstream. Even as far downstream as Kratie, the Yunnan component makes up almost 30% of the average dry season flow. A major concern is that the ongoing and planned expansion of dams and reservoirs on the Mekong mainstream in Yunnan could have a significant effect on the low-flow regime of the lower Mekong basin system.Reach 2: Chiang Saen to Vientiane and Nong Khai. This reach is almost entirely mountainous and covered with natural forest although there has been widespread slash and burn agriculture. Although this reach cannot be termed \"unspoiled\", the hydrological response is perhaps the most natural and undisturbed of all the lower basin. Many hydrological aspects of the lower basin start to change rapidly at the downstream boundary of this reach.On 19 July 2019 this reach of the river dropped to its lowest level in a century. Officials are particularly concerned as July is in the wet season, when mainstream flows are abundant historically. Locals are blaming low water on the newly-constructed Xayaburi Dam, as it enters its test phase prior to the start of commercial operation in October 2019.Reach 3: Vientiane and Nong Khai to Pakse. The boundary between Reach 2 and 3 is where the Mekong hydrology starts to change. Reach 2 is dominated in both wet and dry seasons by the Yunnan Component. Reach 3 is increasingly influenced by contributions from the large left bank tributaries in Laos, namely the Nam Ngum, Nam Theun, Nam Hinboun, Se Bang Fai, Se Bang Hieng, and Se Done Rivers. The Mun-Chi river system from the right bank in Thailand enters the mainstream within this reach.Reach 4: Pakse to Kratie. The main hydrological contributions to the mainstream in this reach come from the Se Kong, Se San, and Sre Pok catchments. Together, these rivers make up the largest hydrological sub-component of the lower basin. Over 25% of the mean annual flow volume to the mainstream at Kratie comes from these three river basins. They are the key element in the hydrology of this part of the system, especially to the Tonle Sap flow reversal.Reach 5: Kratie to Phnom Penh. This reach includes the hydraulic complexities of the Cambodian floodplain, the Tonle Sap and the Great Lake. By this stage, over 95% of the total flow has entered the Mekong system. The focus turns from hydrology and water discharge to the assessment of water level, over- bank storage and flooding and the hydrodynamics that determine the timing, duration and volume of the seasonal flow reversal into and out of the Great Lake.Reach 6: Phnom Penh to the South China Sea. Here the mainstream divides into a complex and increasingly controlled and artificial system of branches and canals. Key features of flow behaviour are tidal influences and salt water intrusion. Every year, 35\u201350% of this reach is flooded during the rainy season. The impact of road embankments and similar infrastructure developments on the movement of this flood water is an increasingly important consequence of development.Table 2 summarises the mean annual flows along the mainstream. The mean annual flow entering the lower Mekong from China is equivalent to a relatively modest 450 mm depth of runoff. Downstream of Vientiane this increases to over 600 mm as the principal left bank tributaries enter the mainstream, mainly the Nam Ngum and Nam Theun. The flow level falls again, even with the right bank entry of the Mun-Chi system from Thailand. Although the Mun\u2013Chi basin drains 20% of the lower system, average annual runoff is only 250 mm. Runoff in the mainstream increases again with the entry from the left bank of the Se Kong from southern Laos and Se San and Sre Pok from Vietnam and Cambodia.\n\nTable 2: Lower Mekong Mainstream annual flow (1960 to 2004) at selected sites.\nFlows at Chiang Saen entering the lower basin from Yunnan make up about 15% of the wet season flow at Kratie. This rises to 40% during the dry season, even this far downstream. During the wet season, the proportion of average flow coming from Yunnan rapidly decreases downstream of Chiang Saen, from 70% to less than 20% at Kratie. The dry season contribution from Yunnan is much more significant. The major portion of the balance comes from Laos, which points to a major distinction in the low-flow hydrology of the river. One fraction comes from melting snow in China and Tibet and the rest from over-season catchment storage in the lower basin. This has implications for the occurrence of drought conditions. For example, if runoff from melting snow in any given year is very low, then flows upstream of Vientiane-Nong Khai would be lower.In a large river system like the Mekong, seasonal flows can be quite variable from year to year. Although the pattern of the annual hydrograph is fairly predictable, its magnitude is not. The average monthly flows along the mainstream are listed in Table 3, providing an indication of their range and variability from year to year. At Pakse, for example, flood season flows during August would exceed 20,000 cubic metres per second nine years out of ten, but exceed 34,000 m3/s only one year in ten.Table 3: Mekong Mainstream monthly discharge, 1960\u20132004 (m3/s).\nThere is little evidence from the last 45 years of data of any systematic changes in the hydrological regime of the Mekong.\n\n\n== Geology ==\nThe internal drainage patterns of the Mekong are unusual when compared to those of other large rivers. Most large river systems that drain the interiors of continents, such as the Amazon, Congo, and Mississippi, have relatively simple dendritic tributary networks that resemble a branching tree.Typically, such patterns develop in basins with gentle slopes where the underlying geological structure is fairly homogenous and stable, exerting little or no control on river morphology. In marked contrast, the tributary networks of the Salween, Yangtze, and particularly the Mekong, are complex with different sub-basins often exhibiting different, and distinct, drainage patterns. These complex drainage systems have developed in a setting where the underlying geological structure is heterogeneous and active, and is the major factor controlling the course of rivers and the landscapes they carve out.The elevation of the Tibetan Plateau during the Tertiary period was an important factor in the genesis of the south-west monsoon, which is the dominant climatic control influencing the hydrology of the Mekong Basin. Understanding the nature and timing of the elevation of Tibet (and the Central Highlands of Vietnam) therefore helps explain the provenance of sediment reaching the delta and the Tonle Sap Great Lake today. Studies of the provenance of sediments in the Mekong delta reveal a major switch in the source of sediments about eight million years ago (Ma). From 36 to 8 Ma the bulk (76%) of the sediments deposited in the delta came from erosion of the bedrock in the Three Rivers Area. From 8 Ma to the present, however, the contribution from the Three Rivers Area fell to 40%, while that from the Central Highlands rose from 11 to 51%. One of the most striking conclusions of provenance studies is the small contribution of sediment from the other parts of the Mekong basin, notably the Khorat Plateau, the uplands of northern Laos and northern Thailand, and the mountain ranges south of the Three Rivers area.\nThe last glacial period came to an abrupt end about 19,000 years ago (19 ka) when sea levels rose rapidly, reaching a maximum of about 4.5 m above present levels in the early Holocene about 8 ka. At this time the shoreline of the South China Sea almost reached Phnom Penh and cores recovered from near Angkor Borei contained sediments deposited under the influence of tides, and salt marsh and mangrove swamp deposits. Sediments deposited in the Tonle Sap Great Lake about this time (7.9\u20137.3 ka) also show indications of marine influence, suggesting a connection to the South China Sea. Although the hydraulic relationships between the Mekong and the Tonle Sap Great Lake systems during the Holocene are not well understood, it is clear that between 9,000 and 7,500 years ago the confluence of the Tonle Sap and the Mekong was in proximity to the South China Sea.\nThe present river morphology of the Mekong Delta developed over the last 6,000 years. During this period, the delta advanced 200 km over the continental shelf of the South China Sea, covering an area of more than 62,500 km2. From 5.3 to 3.5 ka the delta advanced across a broad embayment formed between higher ground near the Cambodian border and uplands north of Ho Chi Minh City. During this phase of its development the delta was sheltered from the wave action of long-shore currents and was constructed largely through fluvial and tidal processes. At this time the delta was advancing at a rate of 17\u201318 m per year. After 3.5 ka, however, the delta had built out beyond the embayment and became subject to wave action and marine currents. These deflected deposition south-eastwards in the direction of the C\u00e0 Mau Peninsula, which is one of the most recent features of the delta.\nFor much of its length the Mekong flows through bedrock channels, i.e., channels that are confined or constrained by bedrock or old alluvium in the bed and riverbanks. Geomorphologic features normally associated with the alluvial stretches of mature rivers, such as meanders, oxbow lakes, cut-offs, and extensive floodplains are restricted to a short stretch of the mainstream around Vientiane and downstream of Kratie where the river develops alluvial channels that are free of control exerted by the underlying bedrock.\nThe Mekong basin is not normally considered a seismically active area as much of the basin is underlain by the relatively stable continental block. Nonetheless, the parts of the basin in northern Laos, northern Thailand, Myanmar and China do experience frequent earthquakes and tremors. The magnitude of these earthquakes rarely exceeds 6.5 on the Richter magnitude scale and is unlikely to cause material damage.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe difficulty of navigating the river has meant that it has divided, rather than united, the people who live near it. The earliest known settlements date to 210 BCE, with Ban Chiang being an excellent example of early Iron Age culture. The earliest recorded civilization was the 1st century Indianised-Khmer culture of Funan, in the Mekong delta. Excavations at Oc Eo, near modern An Giang, have found coins from as far away as the Roman Empire. This was succeeded by the Khmer culture Chenla state around the 5th century. The Khmer empire of Angkor was the last great Indianized state in the region. From around the time of the fall of the Khmer empire, the Mekong was the front line between the emergent states of Siam and Tonkin (North Vietnam), with Laos and Cambodia, then on the coast, torn between their influence.\nThe first European to encounter the Mekong was the Portuguese Antonio de Faria in 1540. A European map of 1563 depicts the river, although even by then little was known of the river upstream of the delta. European interest was sporadic: the Spanish and Portuguese mounted some missionary and trade expeditions, while the Dutch Gerrit van Wuysthoff led an expedition up the river as far as Vientiane in 1641\u201342.\nThe French invaded the region in the mid-19th century, capturing Saigon in 1861, and establishing a protectorate over Cambodia in 1863.\n\nThe first systematic European exploration began with the French Mekong Expedition led by Ernest Doudard de Lagr\u00e9e and Francis Garnier, which ascended the river from its mouth to Yunnan between 1866 and 1868. Their chief finding was that the Mekong had too many falls and rapids to ever be useful for navigation. The river's source was found by Pyotr Kuzmich Kozlov in 1900.\nFrom 1893, the French extended their control of the river into Laos, establishing French Indochina by the first decade of the 20th century. This lasted until the First and Second Indochina Wars expelled French from its former colony and defeated US-supported governments.\n\nDuring the wars in Indochina in the 1970s, a significant quantity of explosives (sometimes, entire barges loaded with military ordnance) sank in the Cambodian section of the Mekong (as well as in the country's other waterways). Besides being a danger for fishermen, unexploded ordnance also creates problems for bridge and irrigation systems construction. As of 2013, Cambodian volunteers are being trained, with the support of the Office of Weapons Removal and Abatement within the US State Department Bureau of Political-Military Affairs, to conduct underwater explosive removal.In 1995, Laos, Thailand, Cambodia, and Vietnam established the Mekong River Commission (MRC) to manage and coordinate the use and care of the Mekong. In 1996 China and Myanmar became \"dialogue partners\" of the MRC and the six countries now work together in a cooperative framework. In 2000, the governments of China, Laos, Thailand and Myanmar signed a Agreement on Commercial Navigation on Lancang-Mekong River among the Governments of the People\u2019s Republic of China,the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic,the Union of Myanmar and the Kingdom of Thailand which is the mechanism for cooperation with regard to riverine trade on the upper stretches of the Mekong.\n\n\n== Natural history ==\n\nThe Mekong basin is one of the richest areas of biodiversity in the world. Only the Amazon boasts a higher level of bio-diversity. Biota estimates for the Greater Mekong Subregion (GMS) include 20,000 plant species, 430 mammals, 1,200 birds, 800 reptiles and amphibians, and an estimated 850 freshwater fish species (excluding euryhaline species mainly found in salt or brackish water, as well as introduced species). The most species rich orders among the freshwater fish in the river basin are cypriniforms (377 species) and catfish (92 species).New species are regularly described from the Mekong. In 2009, 145 species previously unknown to science were described from the region, including 29 fish species, two bird species, 10 reptiles, five mammals, 96 plants, and six amphibians. Between 1997 and 2015, an average of two new species per week were discovered in the region. The Mekong Region contains 16 WWF Global 200 ecoregions, the greatest concentration of ecoregions in mainland Asia.No other river is home to so many species of very large fish. The biggest include three species of Probarbus barbs, which can grow up to 1.5 m (4.9 ft) and weigh 70 kg (150 lb), the giant freshwater stingray (Himantura polylepis, syn. H. chaophraya), which can reach at least 5 m (16 ft) in length and 1.9 m (6.2 ft) in width, the giant pangasius (Pangasius sanitwongsei), giant barb (Catlocarpio siamensis) and the endemic Mekong giant catfish (Pangasianodon gigas). The last three can grow up to about 3 m (9.8 ft) in length and weigh 300 kg (660 lb). All of these have declined drastically because of dams, flood control, and overfishing.One species of freshwater dolphin, the Irrawaddy dolphin (Orcaella brevirostris), was once common in the whole of the lower Mekong but is now very rare, with only 85 individuals remaining.Among other wetland mammals that have been living in and around the river are the smooth-coated otter (Lutra perspicillata) and fishing cat (Prionailurus viverrinus).\nThe endangered Siamese crocodile (Crocodylus siamensis) occurs in small isolated pockets within the northern Cambodian and Laotian portions of the Mekong River. The saltwater crocodile (Crocodylus porosus) once ranged from the Mekong Delta up the river into Tonle Sap and beyond but is now extinct in the river, along with being extinct in all of Vietnam and possibly even Cambodia.\n\n\n=== Protected areas ===\nThe headwaters of the Mekong in Zadoi County, Qinghai, China, are protected in Sanjiangyuan National Nature Reserve. The name Sanjiangyuan means \"the sources of the Three Rivers\". The reserve also includes the headwaters of the Yellow River and the Yangtze.\nThe section of the river flowing through deep gorges in Yunnan Province is part of the Three Parallel Rivers of Yunnan Protected Areas, a UNESCO World Heritage Site.\nThe Tonle Sap Biosphere Reserve in Cambodia contains the largest lake in Southeast Asia. It is a UNESCO Biosphere reserve.\n\n\n=== Natural phenomena ===\nThe low tide level of the river in Cambodia is lower than the high tide level out at sea, and the flow of the Mekong inverts with the tides throughout its stretch in Vietnam and up to Phnom Penh. The very flat Mekong delta area in Vietnam is thus prone to flooding, especially in the provinces of An Giang and Dong Thap (\u0110\u1ed3ng Th\u00e1p), near the Cambodian border.\n\n\n== Fisheries ==\n\nAquatic biodiversity in the Mekong River system is the second highest in the world after the Amazon.\nThe Mekong boasts the most concentrated biodiversity per hectare of any river.The commercially valuable fish species in the Mekong are generally divided between \"black fish\", which inhabit low oxygen, slow moving, shallow waters, and \"white fish\", which inhabit well oxygenated, fast moving, deeper waters. People living within the Mekong River system generate many other sources of food and income from what are often termed \"other aquatic animals\" (OAAs) such as freshwater crabs, shrimp, snakes, turtles, and frogs.\nOAAs account for about 20% of the total Mekong catch. When fisheries are discussed, catches are typically divided between the wild capture fishery (i.e., fish and other aquatic animals caught in their natural habitat), and aquaculture (fish reared under controlled conditions). Wild capture fisheries play the most important role in supporting livelihoods. Wild capture fisheries are largely open access fisheries, which poor rural people can access for food and income.\nBroadly, there are three types of fish habitats in the Mekong: i) the river, including all the main tributaries, rivers in the major flood zone, and the Tonle Sap, which altogether yield about 30% of wild catch landings; ii) rain-fed wetlands outside the river-floodplain zone, including mainly rice paddies in formerly forested areas and usually inundated to about 50 cm, yielding about 66% of wild catch landings; and iii) large water bodies outside the flood zone, including canals and reservoirs yielding about 4% of wild catch landings.The Mekong Basin has one of the world's largest and most productive inland fisheries. An estimated two million tonnes of fish are landed a year, in addition to almost 500,000 tonnes of other aquatic animals. Aquaculture yields about two million tonnes of fish a year. Hence, the lower Mekong basin yields about 4.5 million tonnes of fish and aquatic products annually. The total economic value of the fishery is between US$3.9 and US$7 billion a year. Wild capture fisheries alone have been valued at US$2 billion a year. This value increases considerably when the multiplier effect is included, but estimates vary widely.\nAn estimated 2.56 million tonnes of inland fish and other aquatic animals are consumed in the lower Mekong every year. Aquatic resources make up between 47\u201380% of animal protein in rural diets for people who live in the Lower Mekong Basin. Fish are the cheapest source of animal protein in the region and any decline in the fishery is likely to significantly impact nutrition, especially among the poor. Fish are the staple of the diet in Laos and Cambodia, with around 80% of the Cambodian population's annual protein intake coming from fish caught in the Mekong River system, with no alternative source to replace it. An MRC report claims that dam projects on the Mekong River will reduce aquatic life by 40% by 2020, and predicted that 80% of fish will be depleted by 2040. Thailand will be impacted, as its fish stocks in the Mekong will decline by 55%, Laos will be reduced by 50%, Cambodia by 35%, and Vietnam by 30%.It is estimated that 40 million rural people, more than two-thirds of the rural population in the lower Mekong basin, are engaged in the wild capture fishery. Fisheries contribute significantly to a diversified livelihood strategy for many people, particularly the poor, who are highly dependent on the river and its resources for their livelihoods. They provide a principal form of income for numerous people and act as a safety net and coping strategy in times of poor agricultural harvests or other difficulties. In Laos alone, 71% of rural households (2.9 million people) rely on fisheries for either subsistence or additional cash income. Around the Tonle Sap Lake in Cambodia, more than 1.2 million people live in fishing communes and depend almost entirely on fishing for their livelihoods.\n\n\n== Dams ==\n\nThe Mekong is already heavily dammed, with many more dams planned and under construction, mostly for generating hydropower. China built ten or eleven cascade dams on the Mekong mainstream between 1995 and mid-2019. China, Laos and Cambodia are planning and/or building more. The Mekong is the fastest growing large river basin in the world in terms of hydropower construction. The Lao Government is aiming to lift the nation out of poverty by making it \"the battery of Asia\".Critics fear that China's ability to control the Mekong's flow gives it leverage over downstream nations who rely on China's goodwill. In a worst-case scenario, China could well make demands on thirsty downstream countries who would not be able to refuse. \"China could, in short, use its dams to 'weaponize water'\".The Jinghong Dam, as of January 2020 the nearest Chinese dam upstream of the Thai border, has caused huge fluctuations in river levels, affecting people's livelihoods downstream by disrupting the river's natural cycle. It is exacerbating the effects of climate change and impacting the ecosystem, disturbing the migratory patterns of fish as well as riverbank plants and local agriculture downstream.\n\n\n== Navigation ==\n\nFor thousands of years the Mekong River has been an important conduit for people and goods between the many towns on its banks. Traditional forms of trade in small boats linking communities continue today, however the river is also becoming an important link in international trade routes, connecting the six Mekong countries to each other, and also to the rest of the world. The Mekong is still a wild river and navigation conditions vary greatly along its length. Broadly, navigation of the river is divided between upper and lower Mekong, with the \"upper\" part of the river defined as the stretch north of the Khone Falls in southern Laos and the \"lower\" part as the stretch below these falls.\nNarrower and more turbulent sections of water in the upstream parts of the Mekong River, coupled with large annual water level variations continue to present a challenge to navigation. The seasonal variations in water level directly affect trade in this section of the river. Volumes of trade being shipped decrease by more than 50%, primarily due to the reduced draughts available during the low water season (June\u2013January). Despite these difficulties, the Mekong River is already an important link in the transit chain between Kunming and Bangkok with about 300,000 tonnes of goods shipped via this route each year. The volume of this trade is expected to increase by 8\u201311% per year. Port infrastructure is being expanded to accommodate the expected growth in traffic, with new facilities planned for Chiang Saen port.In Laos, 50 and 100 DWT vessels are operated for regional trade. Cargos carried are timber, agricultural products, and construction materials. Thailand imports a wide variety of products from China, including vegetables, fruit, agricultural products, and fertilisers. The main exports from Thailand are dried longan, fish oil, rubber products, and consumables. Nearly all the ships carrying cargo to and from Chiang Saen Port are 300 DWT Chinese flag vessels.Waterborne trade in the lower Mekong countries of Vietnam and Cambodia has grown significantly, with trends in container traffic at Phnom Penh port and general cargo through Can Tho port both showing steady increases until 2009 when a decrease in cargo volumes can be attributed to the global financial crisis and a subsequent decline in demand for the export of garments to the US. In 2009, Mekong trade received a significant boost with the opening of a new deep-water port at Cai Mep in Vietnam. This new port has generated a renewed focus on the Mekong River as a trade route. The Cai Mep container terminals can accommodate vessels with a draught of 15.2 m, equivalent to the largest container ships in the world. These mother vessels sail directly to Europe or the United States, which means that goods can be shipped internationally to and from Phnom Penh with only a single transshipment at Cai Mep.As an international river, a number of agreements exist between the countries that share the Mekong to enable trade and passage between them. The most important of these, which address the full length of the river, are:\nAgreement between China and Lao PDR on Freight and Passenger Transport along the Lancang\u2013Mekong River, adopted in November 1994.\nAgreement on the Cooperation for the Sustainable Development of the Mekong River Basin, Article 9, Freedom of Navigation, 5 April 1995, Chiang Rai.\nHanoi Agreement between Cambodia and Viet Nam on Waterway Transportation, 13 December 1998.\nAgreement between and among the Governments of the Laos, Thailand, and Vietnam for Facilitation of Cross border Transport of Goods and People, (amended at Yangon, Myanmar), signed in Vientiane, 26 November 1999.\nAgreement on Commercial Navigation on Lancang\u2013Mekong River among the governments of China, Laos, Myanmar and Thailand, adopted at Tachileik, 20 April 2000.\nPhnom Penh Agreement between Cambodia and Vietnam on the Transit of Goods, 7 September 2000.\nNew Agreement on Waterway Transportation between Vietnam and Cambodia, signed in Phnom Penh, 17 December 2009.In December 2016, the Thai cabinet of Prime Minister Prayut Chan-o-cha agreed \"in principle\" to a plan to dredge stretches of the Mekong and demolish rocky outcrops that are hindrances to easy navigation. The international Lancang-Mekong River navigation improvement plan for 2015\u20132025, conceived by China, Myanmar, Lao, and Thailand, aims to the make the river more navigable for 500-tonne cargo vessels sailing the river from Yunnan to Luang Prabang, a distance of 890 kilometres. China has been the driving force behind the demolition plan as it aims to expand trade in the area. The plan is split into two phases. The first phase, from 2015\u20132020, involves a survey, a design, and an assessment of the environmental and social impacts of the project. These have to be approved by the four countries involved: China, Laos, Myanmar, Thailand. The second phase (2020\u20132025) involves navigational improvements from Simao in China to 243 border posts in China and Myanmar, a distance of 259 km. Local groups have countered that native inhabitants already operate their boats year-round and that the plan to blast the rapids is not about making life better for local people, but about enabling year-round traffic of large Chinese commercial boats.On 4 February 2020, the Thai Cabinet voted to stop the project to blast and dredge 97 km of the river bed after Beijing failed to stump up the money for further surveys of the affected area.\n\n\n== Bridges ==\n\nConstruction of Myanmar\u2013Laos Friendship Bridge started on 19 February 2013. The bridge will be 691.6 meters long and have 8.5 meters wide two-lane motorway.The Thai\u2013Lao Friendship Bridge (Thai: \u0e2a\u0e30\u0e1e\u0e32\u0e19\u0e21\u0e34\u0e15\u0e23\u0e20\u0e32\u0e1e \u0e44\u0e17\u0e22-\u0e25\u0e32\u0e27; RTGS: saphan mittra phap thai-lao) connects Nong Khai city with Vientiane in Laos. The 1,170-metre-long (3,840 ft) bridge opened on 8 April 1994. It has two 3.5-metre-wide (11 ft) lanes with a single railway line in the middle. On 20 March 2004, the Thai and Lao governments agreed to extend the railway to Tha Nalaeng in Laos. This extension has since been completed.\nThe Second Thai\u2013Lao Friendship Bridge connects Mukdahan to Savannakhet. The two-lane, 12-metre-wide (39 ft), 1,600-metre-long (5,200 ft) bridge opened to the public on 9 January 2007.\nThe Third Thai\u2013Lao Friendship Bridge opened for traffic on 11 November 2011, connecting Nakhon Phanom Province (Thailand) and Thakhek (Laos), as part of Asian Highway 3. The Chinese and Thai governments agreed to build the bridge and share the estimated US$33 million cost.\nThe Fourth Thai\u2013Lao Friendship Bridge opened to traffic on 11 December 2013. It links Chiang Rai Province, Thailand with Ban Houayxay, Laos.\nThere is one bridge over the Mekong entirely within Laos. Unlike the Friendship Bridges, it is not a border crossing. It is at Pakse in Champasak Province. It is 1,380 meters (4,528 ft) long, and was completed in 2000. 15\u00b06\u203219.95\u2033N 105\u00b048\u203249.51\u2033E).\nThe Kizuna Bridge is in Cambodia, in the city of Kampong Cham, on the road linking Phnom Penh with the remote provinces of Ratanakiri and Mondolkiri, and Laos. The bridge opened for traffic on 11 December 2001.\nThe Prek Tamak Bridge, 40 km north of Phnom Penh opened in 2010.\nPhnom Penh itself has no bridge under construction yet, although two new bridges have recently opened on the Tonle Sap, and the main bridge on the highway to Ho Chi Minh was duplicated in 2010.\nAnother new bridge was built at Neak Leung on the Phnom Penh to Ho Chi Minh Highway 1 with Japanese government assistance, and opened in 2015.\nIn Vietnam, since the year 2000 M\u1ef9 Thu\u1eadn Bridge crosses the first channel\u2014the left, main branch of the Mekong, the S\u00f4ng Ti\u1ec1n or Ti\u1ec1n Giang\u2014near V\u0129nh Long and since 2008 R\u1ea1ch Mi\u1ec5u Bridge crosses it near M\u1ef9 Tho, between the provinces of Ti\u1ec1n Giang and B\u1ebfn Tre.\nC\u1ea7n Th\u01a1 Bridge crosses the second channel\u2014the right, main distributary of the Mekong, the Bassac (Song Hau).  Inaugurated in 2010, it is the longest main span cable-stayed bridge in Southeast Asia.\n\n\n== Environmental issues ==\nDrought linked to a changing climate and dozens of hydroelectric dams are damaging the Mekong ecosystem. When drought ends and the inevitable floods begin, the effects of Mekong dams on flood pulse dynamics over the entire Lower Mekong are poorly understood.Sewage treatment is rudimentary in towns and urban areas throughout much of the Mekong's length, such as Vientiane in Laos. Water pollution impacts the river's ecological integrity as a result.Much of the 8.3 billion tonnes of plastic present on earth makes its way to the oceans. Ninety percent of plastic in the oceans is flushed there by just 10 rivers. The Mekong is one of them.A growing number of academics, NGOs, and scientists urge the international community and the Mekong River Commission to put to rest the myth of sustainable hydro power. They urge an immediate moratorium on new construction and a shift to solar and other forms of renewable energy, already highly competitive and faster to install.\n\n\n== See also ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Further reading ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nThe WISDOM Project, a Water related Information System for the Mekong Delta\nMekong River Commission\nMekong Watch\nCGIAR Challenge Program on Water and Food-Mekong\nMekong Program on Water, Environment and Resilience\nCountries of the Mekong River: The Greater Mekong Subregion Asian Development Bank\nRivers Network : Mekong river blog",

          "We spent a half day on this island and had a good time there. We decided to go to the north end of the island to a public area where local people hang out in small bamboo cottages built into the river. It's worth to spend some hours there as you will get to know much more about",
          "Getting there is part of the fun; there are several ferry points, each of which will introduce you to how the locals travel. I recommend the biggest crossing about 15 minutes outside PP by tuk or car. As always, early morning and late afternoon will give the best views and in",

It is 181,035 square kilometres (69,898 square miles) in area, bordered by Thailand to the northwest, Laos to the northeast, Vietnam to the east and the Gulf of Thailand to the southwest. \nThe sovereign state of Cambodia has a population of over 15 million. The official religion is Theravada Buddhism, practised by approximately 95 percent of the population. Cambodia's minority groups include Vietnamese, Chinese, Chams and 30 hill tribes. The capital and largest city is Phnom Penh, the political, economic and cultural centre of Cambodia. The kingdom is an elective constitutional monarchy with a monarch, currently Norodom Sihamoni, chosen by the Royal Council of the Throne as head of state. The head of government is the Prime Minister, currently Hun Sen, the longest serving non-royal leader in Southeast Asia, ruling Cambodia since 1985.\nIn 802 AD, Jayavarman II declared himself king, uniting the warring Khmer princes of Chenla under the name \"Kambuja\". This marked the beginning of the Khmer Empire, which flourished for over 600 years, allowing successive kings to control and exert influence over much of Southeast Asia and accumulate immense power and wealth. The Indianised kingdom facilitated the spread of first Hinduism and then Buddhism to much of Southeast Asia and undertook many religious infrastructural projects throughout the region, including the construction of more than 1,000 temples and monuments in Angkor alone. Angkor Wat is the most famous of these structures and is designated as a World Heritage Site.\nIn the fifteenth century, after the rebellion of Ayutthaya, which was formerly ruled by the Khmer Empire, Cambodia experienced the decline of power. Cambodia faced two increasingly powerful neighbors, Ayutthaya of Thailand and Nguyen dynasty of Vietnam, and marking the downturn of Cambodia's fate. In 1863, Cambodia became a protectorate of France, and later was incorporated into French Indochina of Southeast Asia.\nCambodia gained independence from France in 1953. The Vietnam War extended into the country in 1965 with the expansion of the Ho Chi Minh Trail and establishment of the Sihanouk Trail. This led to the US bombing of Cambodia from 1969 until 1973. Following the Cambodian coup of 1970 which installed the right-wing pro-US Khmer Republic, the deposed King Sihanouk gave his support to his former enemies, the Khmer Rouge. With the support of the monarchy and North Vietnam, the Khmer Rouge emerged as a major power, taking Phnom Penh in 1975. The Khmer Rouge then carried out the Cambodian genocide from 1975 until 1979, when they were ousted by Vietnam and the Vietnamese-backed People's Republic of Kampuchea, supported by the Soviet Union, in the Cambodian\u2013Vietnamese War.\nFollowing the 1991 Paris Peace Accords, Cambodia was governed briefly by a United Nations mission (1992\u201393). The UN withdrew after holding elections in which around 90 percent of the registered voters cast ballots. The 1997 factional fighting resulted in the ousting of the government by Prime Minister Hun Sen and the Cambodian People's Party, who remain in power as of April 2020.\nCambodia is a member of the United Nations since 1955, ASEAN, the East Asia Summit, the WTO, the Non-Aligned Movement and La Francophonie. According to several foreign organisations, the country has widespread poverty, pervasive corruption, lack of political freedoms, low human development and a high rate of hunger. Cambodia has been described by Human Rights Watch's Southeast Asian Director, David Roberts, as a \"relatively authoritarian coalition via a superficial democracy\". Constitutionally a multi-party liberal democracy, the country is effectively governed under one-party rule as of 2018.While per capita income remains low compared to most neighboring countries, Cambodia has one of the fastest growing economies in Asia, with growth averaging 7.6 percent over the last decade. Agriculture remains the dominant economic sector, with strong growth in textiles, construction, garments and tourism leading to increased foreign investment and international trade. The United Nations designates Cambodia as a least developed country. The US World Justice Project's 2015 Rule of Law Index ranked Cambodia 125th out of 126 countries, far lower compared to other countries in the region.\n\n\n== Name ==\n\nThe \"Kingdom of Cambodia\" is the official English name of the country. The English \"Cambodia\" is an anglicisation of the French \"Cambodge\", which in turn is the French transliteration of the Khmer \u1780\u1798\u17d2\u1796\u17bb\u1787\u17b6 kampuci\u0259. Kampuchea is the shortened alternative to the country's official name in Khmer \u1796\u17d2\u179a\u17c7\u179a\u17b6\u1787\u17b6\u178e\u17b6\u1785\u1780\u17d2\u179a\u1780\u1798\u17d2\u1796\u17bb\u1787\u17b6 pr\u0115\u0259h ri\u0259ci\u0259naacak kampuci\u0259. The Khmer endonym Kampuchea derives from the Sanskrit name \u0915\u092e\u094d\u092c\u094b\u091c\u0926\u0947\u0936 kambojade\u015ba, composed of \u0926\u0947\u0936 de\u015ba (\"land of\" or \"country of\") and \u0915\u092e\u094d\u092c\u094b\u091c kamboja, which alludes to the foundation myths of the first ancient Khmer kingdom. The term Cambodia was already in use in Europe as early as 1524, since Antonio Pigafetta (an Italian explorer who followed Ferdinand Magellan in his circumnavigation of the globe) cites it in his work Relazione del primo viaggio intorno al mondo (1524-1525) as Camogia.Colloquially, Cambodians refer to their country as either \u179f\u17d2\u179a\u17bb\u1780\u1781\u17d2\u1798\u17c2\u179a srok khmae (Khmer pronunciation: [srok \u02c8k\u02b0mae]), meaning \"Khmer's Land\", or the slightly more formal \u1794\u17d2\u179a\u1791\u17c1\u179f\u1780\u1798\u17d2\u1796\u17bb\u1787\u17b6 pr\u0251teih kampuci\u0259 (Khmer pronunciation: [pr\u0251.\u02c8teih kam.pu.ci\u0259]), literally \"Country of Kampuchea\". The name \"Cambodia\" is used most often in the Western world while \"Kampuchea\" is more widely used in the East.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Pre-history ===\n\nThere exists sparse evidence for a Pleistocene human occupation of present-day Cambodia, which includes quartz and quartzite pebble tools found in terraces along the Mekong River, in Stung Treng and Krati\u00e9 provinces, and in Kampot Province, although their dating is unreliable. Some slight archaeological evidence shows communities of hunter-gatherers inhabited the region during Holocene: the most ancient archaeological discovery site in Cambodia is considered to be the cave of L'aang Spean, in Battambang Province, which belongs to the Hoabinhian period. Excavations in its lower layers produced a series of radiocarbon dates around 6000 BC. Upper layers in the same site gave evidence of transition to Neolithic, containing the earliest dated earthenware ceramics in Cambodia.Archaeological records for the period between Holocene and Iron Age remain equally limited. A pivotal event in Cambodian prehistory was the slow penetration of the first rice farmers from the north, which began in the late 3rd millennium BC. The most curious prehistoric evidence in Cambodia are the various \"circular earthworks\" discovered in the red soils near Memot and in the adjacent region of Vietnam in the latter 1950s. Their function and age are still debated, but some of them possibly date from 2nd millennium BC.\n\nOther prehistoric sites of somewhat uncertain date are Samrong Sen (not far from the ancient capital of Oudong), where the first investigations began in 1875, and Phum Snay, in the northern province of Banteay Meanchey. An excavation at Phum Snay revealed 21 graves with iron weapons and cranial trauma which could point to conflicts in the past, possible with larger cities in Angkor. Prehistoric artefacts are often found during mining activities in Ratanakiri.Iron was worked by about 500 BC, with supporting evidence coming from the Khorat Plateau, in modern-day Thailand. In Cambodia, some Iron Age settlements were found beneath Baksei Chamkrong and other Angkorian temples while circular earthworks were found beneath Lovea a few kilometres north-west of Angkor. Burials, much richer than other types of finds, testify to improvement of food availability and trade (even on long distances: in the 4th century BC trade relations with India were already opened) and the existence of a social structure and labour organisation.Among the artefacts from the Iron Age, glass beads are important evidence. Different kinds of glass beads recovered from several sites across Cambodia, such as the Phum Snay site in northwest and the Prohear site in southeast, show that there were two main trading networks at the time. The two networks were separated by time and space, which indicate that there was a shift from one network to the other at about 2nd\u20134th century AD, probably with changes in socio-political powers.\n\n\n=== Pre-Angkorian and Angkorian era ===\n\nDuring the 3rd, 4th, and 5th centuries, the Indianised states of Funan and its successor, Chenla, coalesced in present-day Cambodia and southwestern Vietnam. For more than 2,000 years, what was to become Cambodia absorbed influences from India, passing them on to other Southeast Asian civilisations that are now Thailand and Laos. Little else is known for certain of these polities, however Chinese chronicles and tribute records do make mention of them. It is believed that the territory of Funan may have held the port known to Alexandrian geographer Claudius Ptolemy as \"Kattigara\". The Chinese chronicles suggest that after Jayavarman I of Chenla died around 690, turmoil ensued which resulted in division of the kingdom into Land Chenla and Water Chenla which was loosely ruled by weak princes under the dominion of Java.\nThe Khmer Empire grew out of these remnants of Chenla, becoming firmly established in 802 when Jayavarman II (reigned c790-850) declared independence from Java and proclaimed himself a Devaraja. He and his followers instituted the cult of the God-king and began a series of conquests that formed an empire which flourished in the area from the 9th to the 15th centuries. During the rule of Jayavarman VIII the Angkor empire was attacked by the Mongol army of Kublai Khan, however the king was able to buy peace. Around the 13th century, monks from Sri Lanka introduced Theravada Buddhism to Southeast Asia. The religion spread and eventually displaced Hinduism and Mahayana Buddhism as the popular religion of Angkor; however it was not the official state religion until 1295; when Indravarman III took power.The Khmer Empire was Southeast Asia's largest empire during the 12th century. The empire's centre of power was Angkor, where a series of capitals were constructed during the empire's zenith. In 2007 an international team of researchers using satellite photographs and other modern techniques concluded that Angkor had been the largest pre-industrial city in the world with an urban sprawl of 2,980 square kilometres (1,151 square miles). The city, which could have supported a population of up to one million people and Angkor Wat, the best known and best-preserved religious temple at the site, still serves as a reminder of Cambodia's past as a major regional power. The empire, though in decline, remained a significant force in the region until its fall in the 15th century.\n\n\n=== Post-Angkor Period ===\n\nAfter a long series of wars with neighbouring kingdoms, Angkor was sacked by the Ayutthaya Kingdom and abandoned in 1432 because of ecological failure and infrastructure breakdown. This led to a period of economic, social, and cultural stagnation when the kingdom's internal affairs came increasingly under the control of its neighbours. By this time, the Khmer penchant for monument building had ceased. Older faiths such as Mahayana Buddhism and the Hindu cult of the god-king had been supplanted by Theravada Buddhism.\nThe court moved the capital to Longvek where the kingdom sought to regain its glory through maritime trade. The first mention of Cambodia in European documents was in 1511 by the Portuguese. Portuguese travellers described the city as a place of flourishing wealth and foreign trade. Continued wars with Ayutthaya and the Vietnamese resulted in the loss of more territory and Longvek being conquered and destroyed by King Naresuan the Great of Ayutthaya in 1594. A new Khmer capital was established at Oudong south of Longvek in 1618, but its monarchs could survive only by entering into what amounted to alternating vassal relationships with the Siamese and Vietnamese for the next three centuries with only a few short-lived periods of relative independence.\nThe hill tribe people in Cambodia were \"hunted incessantly and carried off as slaves by the Siamese (Thai), the Annamites (Vietnamese), and the Cambodians\".In the nineteenth century a renewed struggle between Siam and Vietnam for control of Cambodia resulted in a period when Vietnamese officials attempted to force the Khmers to adopt Vietnamese customs. This led to several rebellions against the Vietnamese and appeals to Thailand for assistance. The Siamese\u2013Vietnamese War (1841\u20131845) ended with an agreement to place the country under joint suzerainty. This later led to the signing of a treaty for French Protection of Cambodia by King Norodom Prohmborirak.\n\n\n=== French colonisation ===\n\nIn 1863, King Norodom, who had been installed by Siam, sought the protection of Cambodia from Siam by French rule. In 1867, Rama IV signed a treaty with France, renouncing suzerainty over Cambodia in exchange for the control of Battambang and Siem Reap provinces which officially became part of Siam. The provinces were ceded back to Cambodia by a border treaty between France and Siam in 1907.\nCambodia continued as a protectorate of France from 1867 to 1953, administered as part of the colony of French Indochina, though occupied by the Japanese empire from 1941 to 1945. Between 1874 and 1962, the total population increased from about 946,000 to 5.7 million. After King Norodom's death in 1904, France manipulated the choice of king, and Sisowath, Norodom's brother, was placed on the throne. The throne became vacant in 1941 with the death of Monivong, Sisowath's son, and France passed over Monivong's son, Monireth, feeling he was too independently minded. Instead, Norodom Sihanouk, a maternal grandson of King Sisowath was enthroned. The French thought young Sihanouk would be easy to control. They were wrong, however, and under the reign of King Norodom Sihanouk, Cambodia gained independence from France on 9 November 1953.\n\n\n=== Independence and Vietnam War ===\n\nCambodia became a constitutional monarchy under King Norodom Sihanouk. When French Indochina was given independence, Cambodia lost hope of regaining control over the Mekong Delta as it was awarded to Vietnam. Formerly part of the Khmer Empire, the area had been controlled by the Vietnamese since 1698, with King Chey Chettha II granting the Vietnamese permission to settle in the area decades before. This remains a diplomatic sticking point with over one million ethnic Khmers (the Khmer Krom) still living in this region. The Khmer Rouge attempted invasions to recover the territory which, in part, led to Vietnam's invasion of Cambodia and deposition of the Khmer Rouge.\n\nIn 1955, Sihanouk abdicated in favour of his father to participate in politics and was elected prime minister. Upon his father's death in 1960, Sihanouk again became head of state, taking the title of prince. As the Vietnam War progressed, Sihanouk adopted an official policy of neutrality in the Cold War. Sihanouk allowed the Vietnamese communists to use Cambodia as a sanctuary and a supply route for their arms and other aid to their armed forces fighting in South Vietnam. This policy was perceived as humiliating by many Cambodians. In December 1967 Washington Post journalist Stanley Karnow was told by Sihanouk that if the US wanted to bomb the Vietnamese communist sanctuaries, he would not object, unless Cambodians were killed.The same message was conveyed to US President Johnson's emissary Chester Bowles in January 1968. However, in public Sihanouk refuted the right of the U.S. to use air strikes in Cambodia, and on 26 March he said \"these criminal attacks must immediately and definitively stop\". On 28 March a press conference was held and Sihanouk appealed to the international media: \"I appeal to you to publicise abroad this very clear stand of Cambodia\u2014that is, I will in any case oppose all bombings on Cambodian territory under whatever pretext.\" Nevertheless, the public pleas of Sihanouk were ignored and the bombing continued. Members of the government and army became resentful of Sihanouk's ruling style as well as his tilt away from the United States.\n\n\n=== Khmer Republic (1970\u201375) ===\n\nWhile visiting Beijing in 1970 Sihanouk was ousted by a military coup led by Prime Minister General Lon Nol and Prince Sisowath Sirik Matak. US support for the coup remains unproven. However, once the coup was completed, the new regime, which immediately demanded that the Vietnamese communists leave Cambodia, gained the political support of the United States. The North Vietnamese and Viet Cong forces, desperate to retain their sanctuaries and supply lines from North Vietnam, immediately launched armed attacks on the new government. The king urged his followers to help in overthrowing this government, hastening the onset of civil war.\n\nSoon Khmer Rouge rebels began using him to gain support. However, from 1970 until early 1972, the Cambodian conflict was largely one between the government and army of Cambodia, and the armed forces of North Vietnam. As they gained control of Cambodian territory, the Vietnamese communists imposed a new political infrastructure, which was eventually dominated by the Cambodian communists now referred to as the Khmer Rouge. Between 1969 and 1973, Republic of Vietnam and US forces bombed Cambodia in an effort to disrupt the Viet Cong and Khmer Rouge.\nDocuments uncovered from the Soviet archives after 1991 reveal that the North Vietnamese attempt to overrun Cambodia in 1970 was launched at the explicit request of the Khmer Rouge and negotiated by Pol Pot's then second in command, Nuon Chea. NVA units overran many Cambodian army positions while the Communist Party of Kampuchea (CPK) expanded their small-scale attacks on lines of communication. In response to the North Vietnamese invasion, US President Richard Nixon announced that US and South Vietnamese ground forces had entered Cambodia in a campaign aimed at destroying NVA base areas in Cambodia (see Cambodian Incursion). Although a considerable quantity of equipment was seized or destroyed by US and South Vietnamese forces, containment of North Vietnamese forces proved elusive.\nThe Khmer Republic's leadership was plagued by disunity among its three principal figures: Lon Nol, Sihanouk's cousin Sirik Matak, and National Assembly leader In Tam. Lon Nol remained in power in part because neither of the others was prepared to take his place. In 1972, a constitution was adopted, a parliament elected, and Lon Nol became president. But disunity, the problems of transforming a 30,000-man army into a national combat force of more than 200,000 men, and spreading corruption weakened the civilian administration and army.\nThe Communist insurgency inside Cambodia continued to grow, aided by supplies and military support from North Vietnam. Pol Pot and Ieng Sary asserted their dominance over the Vietnamese-trained communists, many of whom were purged. At the same time, the CPK forces became stronger and more independent of their Vietnamese patrons. By 1973, the CPK were fighting battles against government forces with little or no North Vietnamese troop support, and they controlled nearly 60% of Cambodia's territory and 25% of its population. The government made three unsuccessful attempts to enter into negotiations with the insurgents, but by 1974, the CPK were operating openly as divisions, and some of the NVA combat forces had moved into South Vietnam. Lon Nol's control was reduced to small enclaves around the cities and main transportation routes. More than 2 million refugees from the war lived in Phnom Penh and other cities.\nOn New Year's Day 1975, Communist troops launched an offensive which, in 117 days of the hardest fighting of the war, collapsed the Khmer Republic. Simultaneous attacks around the perimeter of Phnom Penh pinned down Republican forces, while other CPK units overran fire bases controlling the vital lower Mekong resupply route. A US-funded airlift of ammunition and rice ended when Congress refused additional aid for Cambodia. The Lon Nol government in Phnom Penh surrendered on 17 April 1975, just five days after the US mission evacuated Cambodia.\n\n\n=== Khmer Rouge regime, 1975\u20131978 ===\n\nThe Khmer Rouge reached Phnom Penh and took power in 1975. Led by Pol Pot, they changed the official name of the country to Democratic Kampuchea. The new regime modelled itself on Maoist China during the Great Leap Forward, immediately evacuated the cities, and sent the entire population on forced marches to rural work projects. They attempted to rebuild the country's agriculture on the model of the 11th century, discarded Western medicine and destroyed temples, libraries, and anything considered Western.\nEstimates as to how many people were killed by the Khmer Rouge regime range from approximately one to three million; the most commonly cited figure is two million (about a quarter of the population). This era gave rise to the term Killing Fields, and the prison Tuol Sleng became notorious for its history of mass killing. Hundreds of thousands fled across the border into neighbouring Thailand. The regime disproportionately targeted ethnic minority groups. The Cham Muslims suffered serious purges with as much as half of their population exterminated. Pol Pot was determined to keep his power and disenfranchise any enemies or potential threats, and thus increased his violent and aggressive actions against his people.Forced repatriation in 1970 and deaths during the Khmer Rouge era reduced the Vietnamese population in Cambodia from between 250,000 and 300,000 in 1969 to a reported 56,000 in 1984. However, most of the victims of the Khmer Rouge regime were not ethnic minorities but ethnic Khmer. Professionals, such as doctors, lawyers and teachers, were also targeted. According to Robert D. Kaplan, \"eyeglasses were as deadly as the yellow star\" as they were seen as a sign of intellectualism.Religious institutions were not spared by the Khmer Rouge either. Religion was so viciously persecuted to such a terrifying extent that the vast majority of Cambodia's historic architecture, 95% of Cambodia's Buddhist temples, was completely destroyed.\n\n\n=== Vietnamese occupation and transition, 1978\u20131992 ===\n\nIn November 1978, Vietnamese troops invaded Cambodia in response to border raids by the Khmer Rouge. The People's Republic of Kampuchea (PRK), a pro-Soviet state led by the Kampuchean People's Revolutionary Party, a party created by the Vietnamese in 1951, and led by a group of Khmer Rouge who had fled Cambodia to avoid being purged by Pol Pot and Ta Mok, was established. It was fully beholden to the occupying Vietnamese army and under direction of the Vietnamese ambassador to Phnom Penh. Its arms came from Vietnam and the Soviet Union.In opposition to the newly created state, a government-in-exile referred to as the Coalition Government of Democratic Kampuchea (CGDK) was formed in 1981 from three factions. This consisted of the Khmer Rouge, a royalist faction led by Sihanouk, and the Khmer People's National Liberation Front. Its credentials were recognised by the United Nations. The Khmer Rouge representative to the UN, Thiounn Prasith, was retained, but he had to work in consultation with representatives of the noncommunist Cambodian parties. The refusal of Vietnam to withdraw from Cambodia led to economic sanctions by the US and its allies.\n\nPeace efforts began in Paris in 1989 under the State of Cambodia, culminating two years later in October 1991 in a Paris Comprehensive Peace Settlement. The UN was given a mandate to enforce a ceasefire and deal with refugees and disarmament known as the United Nations Transitional Authority in Cambodia (UNTAC).\n\n\n=== Restoration of the monarchy ===\nIn 1993, Norodom Sihanouk was restored as King of Cambodia, but all power was in the hands of the government established after the UNTAC sponsored elections. The stability established following the conflict was shaken in 1997 by a coup d'\u00e9tat led by the co-Prime Minister Hun Sen against the non-communist parties in the government. After its government was able to stabilize under Sen, Cambodia was accepted into the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) on 30 April 1999. In recent years, reconstruction efforts have progressed and led to some political stability through a multiparty democracy under a constitutional monarchy. Although Sen's rule has been marred by human rights abuses and corruption, most Cambodian citizens through the 2000s maintained approval of the government; interviews with rural Cambodians in 2008 displayed a preference for a stable status quo over potentially violent change.In July 2010, Kang Kek Iew was the first Khmer Rouge member found guilty of war crimes and crimes against humanity in his role as the former commandant of the S21 extermination camp and he was sentenced to life in prison. However, Hun Sen has opposed extensive trials of former Khmer Rouge mass murderers.In August 2014, a UN-backed war crimes tribunal, the Extraordinary Chambers in the Courts of Cambodia (also known as the Khmer Rouge Tribunal), sentenced Khieu Samphan, the regime's 83-year-old former head of state, and Nuon Chea, its 88-year-old chief ideologue, to life in prison on war crimes charges for their role in the country's terror period in the 1970s. The trial began in November 2011. Former Foreign Minister Ieng Sary died in 2013, while his wife, Social Affairs Minister Ieng Thirith, was deemed unfit to stand trial due to dementia in 2012.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\nCambodia has an area of 181,035 square kilometres (69,898 square miles) and lies entirely within the tropics, between latitudes 10\u00b0 and 15\u00b0N, and longitudes 102\u00b0 and 108\u00b0E. It borders Thailand to the north and west, Laos to the northeast, and Vietnam to the east and southeast. It has a 443-kilometre (275-mile) coastline along the Gulf of Thailand.Cambodia's landscape is characterised by a low-lying central plain that is surrounded by uplands and low mountains and includes the Tonle Sap (Great Lake) and the upper reaches of the Mekong River delta. Extending outward from this central region are transitional plains, thinly forested and rising to elevations of about 650 feet (200 metres) above sea level.\nTo the north the Cambodian plain abuts a sandstone escarpment, which forms a southward-facing cliff stretching more than 200 miles (320 kilometres) from west to east and rising abruptly above the plain to heights of 600 to 1,800 feet (180\u2013550 metres). This cliff marks the southern limit of the D\u00e2ngr\u00eak Mountains.\nFlowing south through Cambodia's eastern regions is the Mekong River. East of the Mekong the transitional plains gradually merge with the eastern highlands, a region of forested mountains and high plateaus that extend into Laos and Vietnam. In southwestern Cambodia two distinct upland blocks, the Kr\u00e2vanh Mountains and the D\u00e2mrei Mountains, form another highland region that covers much of the land area between the Tonle Sap and the Gulf of Thailand.\nIn this remote and largely uninhabited area, Phnom Aural, Cambodia's highest peak rises to an elevation of 5,949 feet (1,813 metres). The southern coastal region adjoining the Gulf of Thailand is a narrow lowland strip, heavily wooded and sparsely populated, which is isolated from the central plain by the southwestern highlands.\nThe most distinctive geographical feature is the inundations of the Tonle Sap, measuring about 2,590 square kilometres (1,000 square miles) during the dry season and expanding to about 24,605 square kilometres (9,500 square miles) during the rainy season. This densely populated plain, which is devoted to wet rice cultivation, is the heartland of Cambodia. Much of this area has been designated as a biosphere reserve.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\n\nCambodia's climate, like that of the rest of Southeast Asia, is dominated by monsoons, which are known as tropical wet and dry because of the distinctly marked seasonal differences.\nCambodia has a temperature range from 21 to 35 \u00b0C (70 to 95 \u00b0F) and experiences tropical monsoons. Southwest monsoons blow inland bringing moisture-laden winds from the Gulf of Thailand and Indian Ocean from May to October. The northeast monsoon ushers in the dry season, which lasts from November to April. The country experiences the heaviest precipitation from September to October with the driest period occurring from January to February.\nAccording to the International Development Research Center and The United Nations, Cambodia is considered Southeast Asia's most vulnerable country to the effects of climate change, alongside the Philippines. Nearly all provinces in Cambodia are affected by climate change. Rural coastal populations are particularly at risk. Shortages of clean water, extreme flooding, mudslides, higher sea levels and potentially destructive storms are of particular concern, according to the Cambodia Climate Change Alliance.\nCambodia has two distinct seasons. The rainy season, which runs from May to October, can see temperatures drop to 22 \u00b0C (72 \u00b0F) and is generally accompanied with high humidity. The dry season lasts from November to April when temperatures can rise up to 40 \u00b0C (104 \u00b0F) around April. Disastrous flooding occurred in 2001 and again in 2002, with some degree of flooding almost every year.\n\n\n=== Ecology ===\n\nCambodia's biodiversity is largely founded on its seasonal tropical forests, containing some 180 recorded tree species, and riparian ecosystems. There are 212 mammal species, 536 bird species, 240 reptile species, 850 freshwater fish species (Tonle Sap Lake area), and 435 marine fish species recorded by science. Much of this biodiversity is contained around the Tonle Sap Lake and the surrounding biosphere.The Tonle Sap Biosphere Reserve is a reserve surrounding the Tonle Sap lake. It encompasses the lake and nine provinces: Kampong Thom, Siem Reap, Battambang, Pursat, Kampong Chhnang, Banteay Meanchey, Pailin, Oddar Meanchey and Preah Vihear. In 1997, it was successfully nominated as a UNESCO Biosphere Reserve. Other key habitats include the evergreen and dry Dipterocarp forests of Mondolkiri province, protected by Keo Seima Wildlife Sanctuary, Phnom Prich Wildlife Sanctuary, and Srepok Wildlife Sanctuary, as well as Ratanakiri province, and the Cardamom Mountains ecosystem, including Preah Monivong National Park, Botum-Sakor National Park, and the Phnom Aural Wildlife Sanctuary and  Phnom Samkos Wildlife Sanctuary.\nThe Worldwide Fund for Nature recognises six distinct terrestrial ecoregions in Cambodia \u2013 the Cardamom Mountains rain forests, Central Indochina dry forest, Southeast Indochina dry evergreen forest, Southern Annamite Range tropical forest, Tonle Sap freshwater swamp forest, and Tonle Sap-Mekong peat swamp forest.\n\n\n=== Environment ===\n\nCambodia has a bad but improving performance in the global Environmental Performance Index (EPI) with an overall ranking of 146 out of 180 countries in 2016. This is among the worst in the Southeast Asian region, only ahead of Laos and Myanmar. The EPI was established in 2001 by the World Economic Forum as a global gauge to measure how well individual countries perform in implementing the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals.\nThe environmental areas where Cambodia performs worst (i.e. highest ranking) are air quality (148), water resource management (140) and health impacts of environmental issues (137), with the areas of sanitation, environmental impacts of fisheries and forest management following closely. Cambodia performs best when it comes to handling the nitrogen balance in the agricultural industry specifically, an area where Cambodia excels and are among the best in the world. In addition, Cambodia has an unusually large area of wildlife protections, both on land and at sea, with the land-based protections covering about 20% of the country. This secures Cambodia a better than average ranking of 61 in relation to biodiversity and habitat, even though illegal logging, construction and poaching are heavily deteriorating these protections and habitats in reality.\n\nThe rate of deforestation in Cambodia is one of the highest in the world and it is often perceived as the most destructive, singular environmental issue in the country. Cambodia's primary forest cover fell from over 70% in 1969 to just 3.1% in 2007. In total, Cambodia lost 25,000 km2 (9,700 sq mi) of forest between 1990 and 2005 \u2013 3,340 km2 (1,290 sq mi) of which was primary forest. Since 2007, less than 3,220 km2 (1,243 sq mi) of primary forest remain with the result that the future sustainability of the forest reserves of Cambodia is under severe threat.In 2010\u20132015, the annual rate of deforestation was 1.3%. The environmental degradation also includes national parks and wildlife sanctuaries on a large scale and many endangered and endemic species are now threatened with extinction due to loss of habitats. There are many reasons for the deforestation in Cambodia, which range from opportunistic illegal loggings to large scale clearings from big construction projects and agricultural activities. The global issue of land grabbing is particularly rampant in Cambodia. The deforestation involves the local population, Cambodian businesses and authorities as well as transnational corporations from all over the world.Plans for hydroelectric development in the Greater Mekong Subregion, by Laos in particular, pose a \"real danger to the food supply of Vietnam and Cambodia. Upstream dams will imperil the fish stocks that provide the vast majority of Cambodia's protein and could also denude the Mekong River of the silt Vietnam needs for its rice basket.\"\nThe rich fisheries of Tonle Sap, the largest freshwater lake in Southeast Asia, largely supply the impoverished country's protein. The lake is unusual: It all but disappears in the dry season and then expands massively as water flow from the Mekong backs up when the rains come. \"Those fish are so important for their livelihoods, both economically and nutritionally\", said Gordon Holtgrieve, a professor at the University of Washington who researches Cambodia's freshwater fish and he points out that none of the dams that are either built or being built on the Mekong river \"are pointing at good outcomes for the fisheries\".In the 2010s, the Cambodian government and educational system has increased its involvement and co-operation with both national and international environmental groups. A new National Environmental Strategy and Action Plan (NESAP) for Cambodia is to be implemented from late 2016 to 2023 and contains new ideas for how to incite a green and environmentally sustainable growth for the country.In November 2017, the U.S. cut funds to help clear unexploded ordnance including land mines and chemical weapons in Cambodia which it had dropped during the Vietnam War.\n\n\n== Politics ==\n\n\n=== Government ===\n\nNational politics in Cambodia take place within the framework of the nation's constitution of 1993. The government is a constitutional monarchy operated as a parliamentary representative democracy. The Prime Minister of Cambodia, an office held by Hun Sen since 1985, is the head of government, while the King of Cambodia (currently Norodom Sihamoni) is the head of state. The prime minister is appointed by the king, on the advice and with the approval of the National Assembly. The prime minister and the ministerial appointees exercise executive power.\nLegislative powers are shared by the executive and the bicameral Parliament of Cambodia (\u179f\u1797\u17b6\u178f\u17c6\u178e\u17b6\u1784\u179a\u17b6\u179f\u17d2\u178f\u17d2\u179a, saphea damnang reastr), which consists of a lower house, the National Assembly (\u179a\u178a\u17d2\u178b\u179f\u1797\u17b6, rotsaphea) and an upper house, the Senate (\u1796\u17d2\u179a\u17b9\u1791\u17d2\u1792\u179f\u1797\u17b6, protsaphea). Members of the 123-seat Assembly are elected through a system of proportional representation and serve for a maximum term of five years. The Senate has 61 seats, two of which are appointed by the king and two others by the National Assembly, and the rest elected by the commune councillors from 24 provinces of Cambodia. Senators serve six-year terms.On 14 October 2004, King Norodom Sihamoni was selected by a special nine-member Royal Throne Council, part of a selection process that was quickly put in place after the abdication of King Norodom Sihanouk a week prior. Sihamoni's selection was endorsed by Prime Minister Hun Sen and National Assembly Speaker Prince Norodom Ranariddh (the king's half-brother and current chief advisor), both members of the throne council. He was enthroned in Phnom Penh on 29 October 2004.\nOfficially a multiparty democracy, in reality \"the country remains a one-party state dominated by the Cambodian People's Party and Prime Minister Hun Sen, a recast Khmer Rouge official in power since 1985. The open doors to new investment during his reign have yielded the most access to a coterie of cronies of his and his wife, Bun Rany.\" Cambodia's government has been described by the Human Rights Watch's Southeast Asian director, David Roberts, as a \"relatively authoritarian coalition via a superficial democracy\".Prime Minister Hun Sen has vowed to rule until he is 74. He is a former Khmer Rouge member who defected. His government is regularly accused of ignoring human rights and suppressing political dissent. The 2013 election results were disputed by Hun Sen's opposition, leading to demonstrations in the capital. Demonstrators were injured and killed in Phnom Penh where a reported 20,000 protesters gathered, with some clashing with riot police. From a humble farming background, Hun Sen was just 33 when he took power in 1985, and is by some considered a long ruling dictator.Since the 2017 crackdowns on political dissent and free press, Cambodia has been described as a de facto one-party state.\n\n\n=== Political culture ===\n\nThe Cambodian People's Party (CPP) is the sole dominant-party in Cambodia. Since 2018, the CPP commands all but four seats in Parliament, including all 125 seats in the National Assembly and 58 of 62 seats in the Senate.\n\nHun Sen and his government have seen much controversy. Hun Sen was a former Khmer Rouge commander who was originally installed by the Vietnamese and, after the Vietnamese left the country, maintains his strong man position by violence and oppression when deemed necessary. In 1997, fearing the growing power of his co\u2013prime minister, Prince Norodom Ranariddh, Hun launched a coup, using the army to purge Ranariddh and his supporters. Ranariddh was ousted and fled to Paris while other opponents of Hun Sen were arrested, tortured, and some summarily executed.In addition to political oppression, the Cambodian government has been accused of corruption in the sale of vast areas of land to foreign investors resulting in the eviction of thousands of villagers as well as taking bribes in exchange for grants to exploit Cambodia's oil wealth and mineral resources. Cambodia is consistently listed as one of the most corrupt governments in the world. Amnesty International currently recognises one prisoner of conscience in the country: 33-year-old land rights activist Yorm Bopha.Journalists covering a protest over disputed election results in Phnom Penh on 22 September 2013 say they were deliberately attacked by police and men in plain clothes, with slingshots and stun guns. The attack against the president of the Overseas Press Club of Cambodia, Rick Valenzuela, was captured on video.\nThe violence came amid political tensions as the opposition boycotted the opening of Parliament due to concerns about electoral fraud. Seven reporters sustained minor injuries while at least two Cambodian protesters were hit by slingshot projectiles and hospitalized.In 2017 the Cambodia's Supreme Court dissolved the main opposition party, Cambodia National Rescue Party (CNRP), paving the way for a return to a yet more authoritarian political system.\n\n\n=== Corruption ===\n\nThe level of corruption in Cambodia exceeds most countries in the world. Despite adopting an 'Anti-Corruption Law' in 2010, corruption prevails throughout the country. Corruption affects the judiciary, the police and other state institutions. Favouritism by government officials and impunity is commonplace. Lack of a clear distinction between the courts and the executive branch of government also makes for a deep politicisation of the judicial system.Examples of areas where Cambodians encounter corrupt practices in their everyday lives include obtaining medical services, dealing with alleged traffic violations, and pursuing fair court verdicts. Companies deal with extensive red tape when obtaining licenses and permits, especially construction related permits, and the demand for and supply of bribes are commonplace in this process. The 2010 Anti-Corruption Law provided no protection to whistle-blowers, and whistle-blowers can be jailed for up to 6 months if they report corruption that cannot be proven.\n\n\n=== Foreign relations ===\n\nThe foreign relations of Cambodia are handled by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs under Prak Sokhon. Cambodia is a member of the United Nations, the World Bank, and the International Monetary Fund. It is a member of the Asian Development Bank (ADB), ASEAN, and joined the WTO in 2004. In 2005 Cambodia attended the inaugural East Asia Summit in Malaysia.\nCambodia has established diplomatic relations with numerous countries; the government reports twenty embassies in the country including many of its Asian neighbours and those of important players during the Paris peace negotiations, including the US, Australia, Canada, China, the European Union (EU), Japan, and Russia. As a result of its international relations, various charitable organisations have assisted with social, economic, and civil infrastructure needs.\n\nWhile the violent ruptures of the 1970s and 1980s have passed, several border disputes between Cambodia and its neighbours persist. There are disagreements over some offshore islands and sections of the boundary with Vietnam and undefined maritime boundaries. Cambodia and Thailand also have border disputes, with troops clashing over land immediately adjacent to the Preah Vihear temple in particular, leading to a deterioration in relations. Most of the territory belongs to Cambodia, but a combination of Thailand disrespecting international law, Thai troop upbuild in the area and lack of resources for the Cambodian military have left the situation unsettled since 1962.Cambodia and China have cultivated ties in the 2010s. A Chinese company with the support of the People's Liberation Army built a deep-water seaport along 90 km (56 mi) stretch of Cambodian coastline of the Gulf of Thailand in Koh Kong province; the port is sufficiently deep to be used by cruise ships, bulk carriers or warships. Cambodia's diplomatic support has been invaluable to Beijing's effort to claim disputed areas in the South China Sea. Because Cambodia is a member of ASEAN, and because under ASEAN rules \"the objections of one member can thwart any group initiative\", Cambodia is diplomatically useful to China as a counterweight to southeast Asian nations that have closer ties to the United States.\n\n\n=== Military ===\n\nThe Royal Cambodian Army, Royal Cambodian Navy, Royal Cambodian Air Force and Royal Gendarmerie collectively form the Royal Cambodian Armed Forces, under the command of the Ministry of National Defence, presided over by the Prime Minister of Cambodia. His Majesty King Norodom Sihamoni is the Supreme Commander of the Royal Cambodian Armed Forces (RCAF), and the country's Prime Minister Hun Sen effectively holds the position of commander-in-chief.\nThe introduction of a revised command structure early in 2000 was a key prelude to the reorganisation of the Cambodian military. This saw the defence ministry form three subordinate general departments responsible for logistics and finance, materials and technical services, and defence services under the High Command Headquarters (HCHQ).\nThe minister of National Defense is General Tea Banh. Banh has served as defence minister since 1979. The Secretaries of State for Defense are Chay Saing Yun and Por Bun Sreu.\nIn 2010, the Royal Cambodian Armed Forces comprised about 102,000 active personnel (200,000 reserve). Total Cambodian military spending stands at 3% of national GDP. The Royal Gendarmerie of Cambodia total more than 7,000 personnel. Its civil duties include providing security and public peace, to investigate and prevent organised crime, terrorism and other violent groups; to protect state and private property; to help and assist civilians and other emergency forces in a case of emergency, natural disaster, civil unrest and armed conflicts.\nHun Sen has accumulated highly centralised power in Cambodia, including a praetorian guard that 'appears to rival the capabilities of the country's regular military units', and is allegedly used by Hun Sen to quell political opposition.' Cambodia signed the UN treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons.\n\n\n=== Legal profession ===\nThe Cambodian legal profession was established in 1932. By 1978, due to the Khmer Rouge regime, the entire legal system was eradicated. Judges and lawyers were executed after being deemed \"class enemies\" and only 6\u201312 legal professionals actually survived and remained in the country. Lawyers did not reappear until 1995 when the Bar Association of the Kingdom of Cambodia was created.\n\n\n=== Human rights ===\n\n \nA US State Department report says \"forces under Hun Sen and the Cambodian People's Party have committed frequent and large-scale abuses, including extrajudicial killings and torture, with impunity\". According to the 2016 Global Slavery Index, an estimated 256,800 people are enslaved in modern-day Cambodia, or 1.65% of the population.Forced land evictions by senior officials, security forces, and government-connected business leaders are commonplace in Cambodia. Land has been confiscated from hundreds of thousands of Cambodians over more than a decade for the purpose of self-enrichment and maintaining power of various groups of special interests. Credible non-governmental organisations estimate that \"770,000 people have been adversely affected by land grabbing covering at least four million hectares (nearly 10 million acres) of land that have been confiscated\", says Paris-based International Federation for Human Rights (FIDH).On 14 March 2018, the UN expert on the human rights situation in Cambodia \"expressed serious concerns about restrictions on the media, freedom of expression and political participation ahead of a national election in July\". Some critics of the government have been arrested for allegedly spreading fake news about the COVID-19 pandemic in Cambodia.\n\n\n=== Administrative divisions ===\n\nThe autonomous municipality (reach thani) and provinces (khaet) of Cambodia are first-level administrative divisions. Cambodia is divided into 25 provinces including the autonomous municipality.\nMunicipalities and districts are the second-level administrative divisions of Cambodia. The provinces are subdivided into 159 districts and 26 municipalities. The districts and municipalities in turn are further divided into communes (khum) and quarters (sangkat).\n\n\n== Economy ==\n\nIn 2017 Cambodia's per capita income is $4,022 in PPP and $1,309 in nominal per capita. The United Nations designates Cambodia as a least developed country. Most rural households depend on agriculture and its related sub-sectors. Rice, fish, timber, garments and rubber are Cambodia's major exports. The International Rice Research Institute (IRRI) reintroduced more than 750 traditional rice varieties to Cambodia from its rice seed bank in the Philippines. These varieties had been collected in the 1960s.\nBased on the Economist, IMF: Annual average GDP growth for the period 2001\u20132010 was 7.7% making it one of the world's top ten countries with the highest annual average GDP growth. Tourism was Cambodia's fastest growing industry, with arrivals increasing from 219,000 in 1997 to over 2 million in 2007. In 2004, inflation was at 1.7% and exports at $1.6 billion US$.\n\nIn the Cambodia country assessment \"Where Have All The Poor Gone? Cambodia Poverty Assessment 2013\", the World Bank concludes: \"Over the seven years from 2004 through 2011, Cambodian economic growth was tremendous, ranking amid the best in the world. Moreover, household consumption increased by nearly 40 percent. And this growth was pro-poor\u2014not only reducing inequality, but also proportionally boosting poor people's consumption further and faster than that of the non-poor. As a result, the poverty rate dropped from 52.2 to 20.5 percent, surpassing all expectations and far exceeding the country's Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) poverty target. However, the majority of these people escaped poverty only slightly: they remain highly vulnerable\u2014even to small shocks\u2014which could quickly bring them back into poverty.\"\"Two decades of economic growth have helped make Cambodia a global leader in reducing poverty. The success story means the Southeast Asian nation that overcame a vicious civil war now is classified as a lower-middle income economy by the World Bank Group (WBG). Among 69 countries that have comparable data, Cambodia ranked fourth in terms of the fastest poverty reduction in the world from 2004\u20132008. (See more details of Cambodia's achievements on poverty reduction. The poverty rate fell to 10 percent in 2013, and further reduction of poverty is expected for both urban and rural households throughout 2015\u20132016. However, human development, particularly in the areas of health and education, remains an important challenge and development priority for Cambodia\"Oil and natural gas deposits found beneath Cambodia's territorial waters in 2005 yield great potential but remain mostly untapped, due in part to territorial disputes with Thailand.\n\nThe National Bank of Cambodia is the central bank of the kingdom and provides regulatory oversight to the country's banking sector and is responsible in part for increasing the foreign direct investment in the country. Between 2010 and 2012 the number of regulated banks and micro-finance institutions increased from 31 covered entities to over 70 individual institutions underlining the growth within the Cambodian banking and finance sector.\nIn 2012, Credit Bureau Cambodia was established with direct regulatory oversight by the National Bank of Cambodia. The Credit Bureau further increases the transparency and stability within the Cambodian Banking Sector as all banks and microfinance companies are now required by law to report accurate facts and figures relating to loan performance in the country.\nOne of the largest challenges facing Cambodia is still the fact that the older population often lacks education, particularly in the countryside, which suffers from a lack of basic infrastructure. Fear of renewed political instability and corruption within the government discourage foreign investment and delay foreign aid, although there has been significant aid from bilateral and multilateral donors. Donors pledged $504 million to the country in 2004, while the Asian Development Bank alone has provided $850 million in loans, grants, and technical assistance. Bribes are often demanded from companies operating in Cambodia when obtaining licences and permits, such as construction-related permits.\n\nCambodia ranked among the worst places in the world for organised labour in the 2015 International Trade Union Confederation (ITUC) Global Rights Index, landing in the category of countries with \"no guarantee of rights\".'In April 2016 Cambodia's National Assembly has adopted a Law on Trade Unions. \"The law was proposed at a time when workers have been staging sustained protests in factories and in the streets demanding wage increases and improvements in their working conditions\". The concerns about Cambodia's new law are shared not only by labour and rights groups, but international organisations more generally. The International Labour Organization Country Office for Thailand, Cambodia and Lao PDR, has noted that the law has \"several key concerns and gaps\".Independent unions and employers remain divided. \"How can a factory with 25 unions survive?\" asked Van Sou Ieng, chairman of the Garment Manufacturers Association in Cambodia (GMAC), adding that it was \"incomprehensible to expect an employer to negotiate a dispute with 25 different union leaders. A law was necessary to rein in the country's unions, Van Sou Ieng said. According to GMAC, last year there were 3,166 unions for the more than 500,000 workers employed in the country's 557 garment and textile exporting factories, and 58 footwear factories. Though garment production is already Cambodia's largest industry, which accounts for 26.2 percent of the country's Gross Domestic Product, Van Sou Ieng said without the trade union law, foreign investors will not come to do business\".\n\"Only with the trade union law will we, employers, be able to survive.... not only Cambodia, every country has trade union law. Those who criticise [the law] should do businesses, and [then] they will understand.\"\n\n\n=== Textiles ===\n\nThe garment industry represents the largest portion of Cambodia's manufacturing sector, accounting for 80% of the country's exports. In 2012, the exports grew to $4.61 billion up 8% over 2011. In the first half of 2013, the garment industry reported exports worth $1.56 billion. The sector employs 335,400 workers, of which 91% are female.\nBetter Factories Cambodia was created in 2001 as a unique partnership between the UN's International Labour Organization (ILO) and the International Finance Corporation (IFC), a member of the World Bank Group. The programme engages with workers, employers and governments to improve working conditions and boost competitiveness of the garment industry. On 18 May 2018, the Project Advisory Committee (PAC) of the ILO Better Factories Cambodia Programme met in Phnom Penh to provide input into the draft conclusions and recommendations of the BFC's independent mid-term evaluation, as well as to discuss options on how to further strengthen the programme's transparent reporting initiative.\nThe members of the PAC concurred with the findings of the evaluation related to the impact the programme has had on the Cambodian garment sector and workers, including:\na. contributing to sustained overall growth of the garment industry\nb. improving the lives of at least half a million Cambodian workers of factories in the BFC\nprogramme and many more of their family members;\nc. ensuring that workers receive correct wages and social protection benefits\nd. virtually eliminating child labour in the sector\ne. making Cambodia's garment factories safer overall\nf. creating a \"level playing field\" for labour across garment sector\ng. influencing business practices through (1) using factory data to highlight areas for\nimprovement and (2) being a core part of risk management strategies of international\nbrands/buyers.\n\n\n=== Tourism ===\n\nThe tourism industry is the country's second-greatest source of hard currency after the textile industry. International visitor arrivals in 2018 topped six million, a ten-fold increase since the beginning of the 21st century.Besides Phom Penh and Angkor Wat, other tourist destinations include Sihanoukville in the southwest which has several popular beaches and Battambang in the northwest, both of which are popular stops for backpackers who make up a significant portion of visitors to Cambodia. The area around Kampot and Kep including the Bokor Hill Station are also of interest to visitors. Tourism has increased steadily each year in the relatively stable period since the 1993 UNTAC elections.Most international arrivals in 2018 were Chinese. Tourism receipts exceeded US$4.4 billion in 2018, accounting for almost ten percent of the kingdom's gross national product. The Angkor Wat historical park in Siem Reap Province, the beaches in Sihanoukville, the capital city Phnom Penh, and Cambodia's 150 casinos (up from just 57 in 2014) are the main attractions for foreign tourists.\nCambodia's reputation as a safe destination for tourism however has been hindered by civil and political unrest  and several high-profile examples of serious crime committed against tourists visiting the kingdom.Cambodia's tourist souvenir industry employs a lot of people around the main places of interest. The quantity of souvenirs that are produced is not sufficient to face the increasing number of tourists and a majority of products sold to the tourists on the markets are imported from China, Thailand, and Vietnam. Some of the locally produced souvenirs include:\n\nKrama (traditional scarf)\nCeramics\nSoap, candles, spices\nWood carvings, lacquerware, silver plate\nPainted bottles containing infused rice wine\n\n\n=== Agriculture ===\n\nAgriculture is the mainstay of the Cambodian economy. Agriculture accounted for 90 percent of GDP in 1985 and employed approximately 80 percent of the work force. Rice is the principal commodity. Major secondary crops include maize, cassava, sweet potatoes, groundnuts, soybeans, sesame seeds, dry beans, and rubber. The principal commercial crop is rubber. In the 1980s it was an important primary commodity, second only to rice, and one of the country's few sources of foreign exchange.\n\n\n=== Transport ===\n\nThe civil war and neglect severely damaged Cambodia's transport system. With assistance from other countries Cambodia has been upgrading the main highways to international standards and most are vastly improved from 2006. Most main roads are now paved.\n\nCambodia has two rail lines, totalling about 612 kilometres (380 miles) of single, one-metre (3-foot-3-inch) gauge track. The lines run from the capital to Sihanoukville on the southern coast. Trains are again running to and from the Cambodian capital and popular destinations in the south. After 14 years, regular rail services between the two cities restarted recently \u2013 offering a safer option than road for travellers. Trains also run from Phnom Penh to Sisophon (although trains often run only as far as Battambang). As of 1987, only one passenger train per week operated between Phnom Penh and Battambang but a US$141 million project, funded mostly by the Asian Development Bank, has been started to revitalise the languishing rail system that will \"(interlink) Cambodia with major industrial and logistics centers in Bangkok and Ho Chi Minh City\".Besides the main inter-provincial traffic artery connecting Phnom Penh with Sihanoukville, resurfacing a former dirt road with concrete / asphalt and bridging five major river crossings have now permanently connected Phnom Penh with Koh Kong, and hence there is now uninterrupted road access to neighbouring Thailand and its road network.\n\nCambodia's road traffic accident rate is high by world standards. In 2004, the number of road fatalities per 10,000 vehicles was ten times higher in Cambodia than in the developed world, and the number of road deaths had doubled in the preceding three years.Cambodia's extensive inland waterways were important historically in international trade. The Mekong and the Tonle Sap River, their numerous tributaries, and the Tonle Sap provided avenues of considerable length, including 3,700 kilometres (2,300 miles) navigable all year by craft drawing 0.6 metres (2.0 feet) and another 282 kilometres (175 miles) navigable to craft drawing 1.8 metres (5.9 feet).Cambodia has two major ports, Phnom Penh and Sihanoukville, and five minor ones. Phnom Penh, at the junction of the Bassac, the Mekong, and the Tonle Sap Rivers, is the only river port capable of receiving 8,000-ton ships during the wet season and 5,000-ton ships during the dry season.\nWith increasing economic activity has come an increase in automobile use, though motorcycles still predominate. \"Cyclo\" (as hand-me-down French) or Cycle rickshaws were popular in 1990s but are increasingly replaced by remorques (carriages attached to motorcycles) and rickshaws imported from India. Cyclos are unique to Cambodia in that the cyclist sits behind the passenger seat.Cambodia has three commercial airports. In 2018, they handled a record of 10 million passengers. Phnom Penh International Airport is the busiest airport in Cambodia. Siem Reap-Angkor International Airport is the second busiest, and serves the most international flights in and out of Cambodia. Sihanouk International Airport, is in the coastal city of Sihanoukville.\n\n\n== Society ==\n\n\n=== Demographics ===\n\nFifty percent of the Cambodian population is younger than 22 years old. At a 1.04 female to male ratio, Cambodia has the most female-biased sex ratio in the Greater Mekong Subregion. Among the Cambodian population aged over 65, the female to male ratio is 1.6:1.The total fertility rate in Cambodia was 3.0 children per woman in 2010. The fertility rate was 4.0 children in 2000. Women in urban areas have 2.2 children on average, compared with 3.3 children per woman in rural areas. Fertility is highest in Mondol Kiri and Rattanak Kiri Provinces, where women have an average of 4.5 children, and lowest in Phnom Penh where women have an average of 2.0 children.\n\n\n=== Ethnic groups ===\n\nThe vast majority of Cambodia's population is of ethnic Khmer origin (over 95%) who are speakers of the Khmer language, the country's sole official language. Cambodia's population is largely homogeneous. Its minority groups include Chams (1.2%), Vietnamese (0.1%) and Chinese (0.1%).The largest ethnic group in Cambodia are the Khmers, who comprise around 90% of the total population in Cambodia, and are indigenous to the lowland Mekong subregion in which they inhabit. The Khmers historically have lived near the lower Mekong River in a contiguous diagonal arc, from where modern-day Thailand, Laos and Cambodia meet in the northwest, all the way to the mouth of the Mekong River in southeastern Vietnam.\nThe Vietnamese are the second largest ethnic minority in Cambodia, with an estimated 16,000 living in provinces concentrated in the southeast of the country adjacent to the Mekong Delta. Although the Vietnamese language has been determined to be a Mon\u2013Khmer language, there are very few cultural connections between the two peoples because the early Khmers were influenced by the Indian cultural sphere while the Vietnamese are part of the Chinese cultural sphere. Ethnic tensions between the Khmer and the Vietnamese can be traced to the Post-Angkor Period (from the 16th to 19th centuries), during which time a nascent Vietnam and Thailand each attempted to vassalise a weakened post-Angkor Cambodia, and effectively dominate all of Indochina.Chinese Cambodians are approximately 0.1% of the population. Most Chinese are descended from 19th\u201320th-century settlers who came in search of trade and commerce opportunities during the time of the French protectorate. Most are urban dwellers, engaged primarily in commerce.\nThe indigenous ethnic groups of the mountains are known collectively as Montagnards or Khmer Loeu, a term meaning \"Highland Khmer\". They are descended from neolithic migrations of Mon\u2013Khmer speakers via southern China and Austronesian speakers from insular Southeast Asia. Being isolated in the highlands, the various Khmer Loeu groups were not Indianized like their Khmer cousins and consequently are culturally distant from modern Khmers and often from each other, observing many pre-Indian-contact customs and beliefs.\nThe Cham are descended from the Austronesian people of Champa, a former kingdom on the coast of central and southern present-day Vietnam and former rival to the Khmer Empire. The Cham in Cambodia number under a million and often maintain separate villages in the southeast of the country. Almost all Cham in Cambodia are Muslims.\n\n\n=== Population centres ===\n\n\n=== Languages ===\n\nThe Khmer language is a member of the Mon\u2013Khmer subfamily of the Austroasiatic language group. French, once the language of government in Indochina, is still spoken by many older Cambodians, and is also the language of instruction in some schools and universities that are funded by the government of France. There is also a French-language newspaper and some TV channels are available in French. Cambodia is a member of La Francophonie. Cambodian French, a remnant of the country's colonial past, is a dialect found in Cambodia and is sometimes used in government, particularly in court. Since 1993, there has been a growing use of English, which has been replacing French as the main foreign language. English is widely taught in several universities and there is also a significant press in that language, while street signs are now bilingual in Khmer and English. Due to this shift, English is now mostly used in Cambodia's international relationships and has replaced French both in Cambodia's stamps, since 2002, and currency.The Khmer script is derived from the South Indian Pallava script.\n\n\n=== Religion ===\n\nTheravada Buddhism is the official religion of Cambodia, practised by more than 95 percent of the population with an estimated 4,392 monastery temples throughout the country. Cambodian Buddhism is deeply influenced by Hinduism and native animism.\nThe close interrelationship between spirits and the community, the efficacy of apotropaic and luck-attracting actions and charms, and the possibility of manipulating one's life through contact with spiritual entities such as the \"baromey\" spirits originates from the native folk religion. Hinduism has left little trace beyond the magical practices of Tantricism and a host of Hindu gods now assimilated into the spirit world (for example, the important neak ta spirit called Yeay Mao is the modern avatar of the Hindu goddess Kali).\nMahayana Buddhism is the religion of the majority of Chinese and Vietnamese in Cambodia. Elements of other religious practices, such as the veneration of folk heroes and ancestors, Confucianism, and Taoism mix with Chinese Buddhism are also practised.\nIslam is followed by about 2% of the population and comes in three varieties, two practised by the Cham people and a third by the descendants of Malays, resident in the country for generations. Cambodia's Muslim population is reported to be 80% ethnic Cham.\n\n\n=== Health ===\n\nCambodian life expectancy was 72 years in 2014, a major improvement since 1995 when the average life expectancy was 55. Health care is offered by both public and private practitioners and research has found that trust in health providers is a key factor in improving the uptake of health care services in rural Cambodia. The government plans to increase the quality of healthcare in the country by raising awareness of HIV/AIDS, malaria, and other diseases.\nCambodia's infant mortality rate has decreased from 115 per 1,000 live births in 1993 to 54 in 2009. In the same period, the under-five mortality rate decreased from 181 to 115 per 1,000 live births. In the province with worst health indicators, Ratanakiri, 22.9% of children die before age five.Cambodia was once one of the most landmined countries in the world. According to some estimates, unexploded land mines have been responsible for over 60,000 civilian deaths and thousands more maimed or injured since 1970. The number of reported landmine casualties has sharply decreased, from 800 in 2005 to 111 in 2013 (22 dead and 89 injured). Adults that survive landmines often require amputation of one or more limbs and have to resort to begging for survival. Cambodia is expected to be free of land mines by 2020 but the social and economic legacy, including orphans and one in 290 people being an amputee, is expected to affect Cambodia for years to come.\nIn Cambodia, landmines and exploded ordnance alone have caused 44,630 injuries between 1979 and 2013, according to the Cambodia Mine/UXO Victim Information System.\n\n\n=== Education ===\n\nThe Ministry of Education, Youth and Sports is responsible for establishing national policies and guidelines for education in Cambodia. The Cambodian education system is heavily decentralised, with three levels of government, central, provincial and district \u2013 responsible for its management. The constitution of Cambodia promulgates free compulsory education for nine years, guaranteeing the universal right to basic quality education.\n\nThe 2008 Cambodian census estimated that 77.6% of the population was literate (85.1% of men and 70.9% of women). Male youth age (15\u201324 years) have a literacy rate of 89% compared to 86% for females.The education system in Cambodia continues to face many challenges, but during the past years there have been significant improvements, especially in terms of primary net enrolment gains, the introduction of program based-budgeting, and the development of a policy framework which helps disadvantaged children to gain access to education. The country has also significantly invested in vocational education, especially in rural areas, to tackle poverty and unemployment.\n Two of Cambodia's most acclaimed universities are based in Phnom Penh.\nTraditionally, education in Cambodia was offered by the wats (Buddhist temples), thus providing education exclusively for the male population. During the Khmer Rouge regime, education suffered significant setbacks. Education has also suffered setbacks from child labour, A study by Kim (2011) reports that most employed children in Cambodia are enrolled in school but their employment is associated with late school entry, negative impacts on their learning outcomes, and increased drop out rates.With respects to academic performance among Cambodian primary school children, research showed that parental attitudes and beliefs played a significant role. Specifically, the study found that poorer academic achievement among children were associated with parents holding stronger fatalistic beliefs (i.e., human strength cannot change destiny). The study further found that \"length of residence\" of parents in the community in which they stay predicted better academic achievement among their children. Overall, the study pointed out to the role of social capital in educational performance and access in the Cambodian society in which family attitudes and beliefs are central to the findings.\n\n\n=== Crime ===\n\nIn 2012, Cambodia had a murder rate of 6.5 per 100,000 population. On a national level, there were a total of 964 murders reported in 2012.Prostitution is illegal in Cambodia but yet appears to be prevalent. In a series of 1993 interviews of women about prostitution, three quarters of the interviewees found being a prostitute to be a norm and a profession they felt was not shameful having. That same year, it was estimated that there were about 100,000 sex workers in Cambodia.On 18 August, Prime Minister Hun Sen signed a directive banning the Finance Ministry from issuing new online gambling licenses, while operators currently holding online licenses would only be allowed to continue operating until those licenses expire. The directive cited the fact that \"some foreigners have used this form of gambling to cheat victims inside and outside the country\" as justifying the new policy. Cambodia had issued over 150 such licenses before the new policy was announced.\n\n\n== Culture ==\n\nVarious factors contribute to the Cambodian culture including Theravada Buddhism, Hinduism, French colonialism, Angkorian culture, and modern globalization. The Cambodian Ministry of Culture and Fine Arts is responsible for promoting and developing Cambodian culture. Cambodian culture not only includes the culture of the lowland ethnic majority, but also some 20 culturally distinct hill tribes colloquially known as the Khmer Loeu, a term coined by Norodom Sihanouk to encourage unity between the highlanders and lowlanders.\nRural Cambodians wear a krama scarf which is a unique aspect of Cambodian clothing. The sampeah is a traditional Cambodian greeting or a way of showing respect to others. Khmer culture, as developed and spread by the Khmer empire, has distinctive styles of dance, architecture and sculpture, which have been exchanged with neighbouring Laos and Thailand throughout history. Angkor Wat (Angkor means \"city\" and Wat \"temple\") is the best preserved example of Khmer architecture from the Angkorian era along with hundreds of other temples that have been discovered in and around the region.\nTraditionally, the Khmer people have a recorded information on Tra leaves. Tra leaf books record legends of the Khmer people, the Ramayana, the origin of Buddhism and other prayer books. They are taken care of by wrapping in cloth to protect from moisture and the climate.Bon Om Tuuk (Festival of Boat Racing), the annual boat rowing contest, is the most attended Cambodian national festival. Held at the end of the rainy season when the Mekong river begins to sink back to its normal levels allowing the Tonle Sap River to reverse flow, approximately 10% of Cambodia's population attends this event each year to play games, give thanks to the moon, watch fireworks, dine, and attend the boat race in a carnival-type atmosphere.Popular games include soccer, kicking a sey, which is similar to a footbag, and chess. Based on the classical Indian solar calendar and Theravada Buddhism, the Cambodian New Year is a major holiday that takes place in April. Recent artistic figures include singers Sinn Sisamouth and Ros Serey Sothea (and later Meng Keo Pichenda), who introduced new musical styles to the country.\nEvery year, Cambodians visit pagodas across the country to mark the 'Festival of the Dead' or Pchum Ben. During the 15-day festival, people offer prayers and food to the spirits of their dead relatives. For most of the Cambodians, it is a time to remember their relatives, who died during 1975-1979 Khmer Rouge regime.\n\n\n=== Cuisine ===\n\nRice is the staple grain, as in other Southeast Asian countries. Fish from the Mekong and Tonle Sap rivers is also an important part of the diet. The supply of fish and fish products for food and trade as of 2000 was 20 kilograms (44 pounds) per person or 2 ounces per day per person. Some of the fish can be made into prahok for longer storage.\nThe cuisine of Cambodia contains tropical fruits, soups and noodles. Key ingredients are kaffir lime, lemon grass, garlic, fish sauce, soy sauce, curry, tamarind, ginger, oyster sauce, coconut milk and black pepper. Some delicacies are \u1793\u17c6\u1794\u1789\u17d2\u1785\u17bb\u1780 (Num Banh chok), \u17a2\u17b6\u1798\u17c9\u17bb\u1780 (Amok), \u17a2\u17b6\u1796\u17b8\u1784 (Ah Ping). The country also boasts various distinct local street foods, such as fried spiders.\nFrench influence on Cambodian cuisine includes the Cambodian red curry with toasted baguette bread. The toasted baguette pieces are dipped in the curry and eaten. Cambodian red curry is also eaten with rice and rice vermicelli noodles. Probably the most popular dine out dish, kuy teav, is a pork broth rice noodle soup with fried garlic, scallions, green onions that may also contain various toppings such as beef balls, shrimp, pork liver or lettuce. Kampot pepper is reputed to be the best in the world and accompanies crab at the Kep crab shacks and squid in the restaurants on the Ou Trojak Jet river. The cuisine is relatively unknown to the world compared to that of its neighbours Thailand and Vietnam.\n\n\n=== Drinks ===\nCambodians drink plenty of tea, grown in Mondulkiri Province and around Kirirom. tai krolap is a strong tea, made by putting water and a mass of tea leaves into a small glass, placing a saucer on top, and turning the whole thing upside down to brew. When it's dark enough, the tea is decanted into another cup and plenty of sugar added, but no milk. Lemon tea tai kdao kroich chhmaa, made with Chinese red-dust tea and lemon juice, is refreshing both hot and iced, and is generally served with a hefty dose of sugar.Regarding coffee, the beans are generally imported from Laos and Vietnam \u2013 although domestically produced coffee from Ratanakiri Province and Mondulkiri Province can be found in some places. Beans are traditionally roasted with butter and sugar, plus various other ingredients that might include anything from rum to pork fat, giving the beverage a strange, sometimes faintly chocolatey aroma.Cambodia has several industrial breweries, located mainly in Sihanoukville Province and Phnom Penh. There are also a growing number of microbreweries in Phnom Penh and Siem Reap. Between 2014 and 2018, the number of craft beer breweries rose from two to nine. As of 2019, there are 12 brewpubs or microbreweries in Cambodia.Rice wine is a popular alcoholic drink. Its quality varies widely and it is often infused with fruits or medicinal herbs. When prepared with macerated fruits or spices, like the Sombai liqueur, it is called sraa tram (or soaked wine) and has gained more and more popularity with the development of tourism as it is smoother to drink than plain rice wine.\n\n\n=== Women ===\n\nKhmer women are traditionally expected to be modest, soft-spoken, well-mannered, industrious, act as the family's caregivers and caretakers and financial controllers, maintain their virginity until marriage, become faithful wives, and act as advisors to their husbands. The \"light\" walking and refinement of Cambodian women is further described as being \"quiet in [...] movements that one cannot hear the sound of their silk skirt rustling\". As financial controllers, the women of Cambodia can be identified as having household authority at the familial level.\n\n\n=== Sports ===\n\nFootball (soccer) is one of the most popular sports, although professional organised sports are not as prevalent in Cambodia as in western countries because of the economic conditions. Soccer was brought to Cambodia by the French and became popular with the locals. The Cambodia national football team managed fourth in the 1972 Asian Cup, but development has slowed since the civil war.\nWestern sports such as basketball, volleyball, bodybuilding, field hockey, rugby union, golf, and baseball are gaining popularity. Volleyball is by far the most popular sport in the country. Native sports include traditional boat racing, buffalo racing, Pradal Serey, Khmer traditional wrestling and Bokator. Cambodia first participated in the Olympics during the 1956 Summer Olympic Games sending equestrian riders. Cambodia also hosted the GANEFO Games, the alternative to the Olympics, in the 1960s.\n\n\n=== Dance ===\n\nCambodian dance can be divided into three main categories: Khmer classical dance, folk dance, and social dances. The exact origins of Khmer classical dance are disputed. Most native Khmer scholars trace modern dance forms back to the time of Angkor, seeing similarities in the temple engravings of the period, while others hold that modern Khmer dance styles were learned (or re-learned) from Siamese court dancers in the 1800s.\nKhmer classical dance is the form of stylised performance art established in the royal courts of Cambodia exhibited for both entertainment and ceremonial purposes. The dances are performed by intricately costumed, highly trained men and women on public occasions for tribute, invocation or to enact traditional stories and epic poems such as Reamker, the Khmer version of the Ramayana. Known formally as Robam Preah Reach Trop (\u179a\u1794\u17b6\u17c6\u1796\u17d2\u179a\u17c7\u179a\u17b6\u1787\u1791\u17d2\u179a\u1796\u17d2\u1799 \"theater of royal wealth\") it is set to the music of a pinpeat ensemble accompanied by a vocal chorus.\nCambodian folk dance, often performed to mahori music, celebrates the various cultural and ethnic groups of Cambodia. Folk dances originated in the villages and are performed, for the most part, by the villagers for the villagers. The movements are less stylised and the clothing worn is that of the people the dancers are portraying, such as hill tribes, Chams or farmers. Typically faster-paced than classical dance, folk dances display themes of the \"common person\" such as love, comedy or warding off evil spirits.Social dances are those performed by guests at banquets, parties or other informal social gatherings. Khmer traditional social dances are analogous to those of other Southeast Asian nations. Examples include the circle dances Romvong and Romkbach as well as Saravan and Lam Leav. Modern western popular dances including Cha-cha, Bolero, and the Madison, have also influenced Cambodian social dance.\n\n\n=== Music ===\n\nTraditional Cambodian music dates back as far as the Khmer Empire. Royal dances like the Apsara Dance are icons of the Cambodian culture as are the Mahori ensembles that accompany them. More rural forms of music include Chapei and A Yai. The former is popular among the older generation and is most often a solo performance of a man plucking a Cambodian guitar (chapei) in between a cappella verses. The lyrics usually have moral or religious theme.\nA Yai can be performed solo or by a man and woman and is often comedic in nature. It is a form of lyrical poetry, often full of double entendres, that can be either scripted or completely impromptu and ad-libbed. When sung by a duo, the man and women take turns, \"answering\" the other's verse or posing riddles for the other to solve, with short instrumental breaks in between verses. Pleng kaah (lit. \"wedding music\") is a set of traditional music and songs played both for entertainment and as accompaniment for the various ceremonial parts of a traditional, days-long Khmer wedding.\nCambodian popular music is performed with western style instruments or a mixture of traditional and western instruments. Dance music is composed in particular styles for social dances. The music of crooner Sinn Sisamouth and Ros Sereysothea from the 1960s to the 1970s is considered to be the classic pop music of Cambodia. During the Khmer Rouge Revolution, many classic and popular singers of the 1960s and 1970s were murdered, starved to death, or overwork to death by the Khmer Rouge. and many original master tapes from the period were lost or destroyed.\nIn the 1980s, Keo Surath, (a refugee resettled in the United States) and others carried on the legacy of the classic singers, often remaking their popular songs. The 1980s and 1990s also saw the rise in popularity of kantrum, a music style of the Khmer Surin set to modern instrumentation.The Australian hip hop group Astronomy Class has recorded with Kak Channthy, a native born Cambodian female singer.The Dengue Fever rock and roll band features a Cambodian female singer and back-up band from California. It is classified as \"world music\" and combines Cambodian music with Western style rock.\n\n\n== Science and technology ==\n\nA National Committee for Science and Technology representing 11 ministries has been in place since 1999. Although seven ministries are responsible for the country's 33 public universities, the majority of these institutions come under the umbrella of the Ministry of Education, Youth and Support.In 2010, the Ministry of Education, Youth and Support approved a Policy on Research Development in the Education Sector. This move represented a first step towards a national approach to research and development across the university sector and the application of research for the purposes of national development.This policy was followed by the country's first National Science and Technology Master Plan 2014\u20132020. It was officially launched by the Ministry of Planning in December 2014, as the culmination of a two-year process supported by the Korea International Cooperation Agency. The plan makes provision for establishing a science and technology foundation to promote industrial innovation, with a particular focus on agriculture, primary industry and ICTs.\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nIndex of Cambodia-related articles\nOutline of Cambodia\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n=== Citations ===\n\n\n=== Cited sources ===\n\n\n== External links ==\n\n\"Cambodia\".

'City of the Brahma's Faces') or shortly known as Krong Chaktomuk (Khmer: \u1780\u17d2\u179a\u17bb\u1784\u1785\u178f\u17bb\u1798\u17bb\u1781), is the capital and most populous city in Cambodia. Phnom Penh has been the national capital since French colonization of Cambodia, and has grown to become the nation's economic, industrial, and cultural center.\nOnce known as the \"Pearl of Asia,\" it was considered one of the loveliest French-built cities in Indochina in the 1920s. Phnom Penh, along with Siem Reap and Sihanoukville, are significant global and domestic tourist destinations for Cambodia. Founded in 1372, the city is noted for its historical architecture and attractions. It became the national capital in 1434 following the fall of Angkor, and remained so until 1497. It regained its capital status during the French colonial era in 1865. There are a number of surviving French colonial buildings scattered along the grand boulevards.\nOn the banks of the Tonl\u00e9 Sap, Mekong, and Bassac Rivers, Phnom Penh is home to more than 2 million people, approximately 14% of the Cambodian population.\n\n\n== Etymology ==\nPhnom Penh (literally, 'Penh's Hill') takes its name from the present Wat Phnom ('Hill Temple'). Legend has it that in 1372, a wealthy widow named Lady Penh found a Koki tree floating down the Tonle Sap river after a storm. Inside the tree were four bronze Buddha statues and a stone statue of Vishnu. Daun Penh ordered villagers to raise the height of the hill northeast of her house and used the Koki wood to build a temple on the hill to house the four Buddha statues, and a shrine for the Vishnu image slightly lower down. The temple became known as Wat Phnom Daun Penh, which is now known as Wat Phnom, a small hill 27 metres (89 ft) in height.\nPhnom Penh's official name, in its short form, is Krong Chaktomok (Khmer: \u1780\u17d2\u179a\u17bb\u1784\u1785\u178f\u17bb\u1798\u17bb\u1781) meaning \"City of Four Faces\".

This loosely translates as \"The place of four rivers that gives the happiness and success of Khmer Kingdom, the highest leader as well as impregnable city of the God Indra of the great kingdom\".\n\n\n== History ==\nFirst recorded a century after it is said to have taken place, the legend of the founding of Phnom Penh tells of a local woman, Penh (commonly referred to as Daun Penh (\"Grandmother Penh\" or \"Old Lady Penh\") in Khmer), living at Chaktomuk, the future Phnom Penh. It was the late 14th century, and the Khmer capital was still at Angkor near Siem Reap 350 km (217 mi) to the north. Gathering firewood along the banks of the river, Lady Penh spied a floating koki tree in the river and fished it from the water. Inside the tree she found four Buddha statues and one of Vishnu.\nThe discovery was taken as a divine blessing, and to some a sign that the Khmer capital was to be brought to Phnom Penh from Angkor. To house the new-found sacred objects, Penh raised a small hill on the west bank of the Tonle Sap River and crowned it with a shrine, now known as Wat Phnom at the north end of central Phnom Penh. \"Phnom\" is Khmer for \"hill\" and Penh's hill took on the name of the founder, and the area around it became known after the hill.\nPhnom Penh first became the capital of Cambodia after Ponhea Yat, king of the Khmer Empire, moved the capital from Angkor Thom after it was captured and destroyed by Siam a few years earlier. There is a stupa behind Wat Phnom that houses the remains of Ponhea Yat and the royal family as well as the remaining Buddhist statues from the Angkorean era. In the 17th century, Japanese immigrants also settled on the outskirts of present-day Phnom Penh. A small Portuguese community survived in Phnom Penh until the 17th century, undertaking commercial and religious activity in the country.\nPhnom Penh remained the royal capital for 73 years, from 1432 to 1505. It was abandoned for 360 years (from 1505 to 1865) by subsequent kings due to internal fighting between the royal pretenders. Later kings moved the capital several times and established their royal capitals at various locations in Tuol Basan (Srey Santhor), Pursat, Longvek, Lavear Em and Oudong.\nIt was not until 1866, under the reign of King Norodom I (1860\u20131904), the eldest son of King Ang Duong, who ruled on behalf of Siam, that Phnom Penh became the permanent seat of government and capital of Cambodia, and also where the current Royal Palace was built. Beginning in 1870, the French colonial authorities turned a riverside village into a city where they built hotels, schools, prisons, barracks, banks, public works offices, telegraph offices, law courts, and health services buildings. In 1872, the first glimpse of a modern city took shape when the colonial administration employed the services of French contractor Le Faucheur to construct the first 300 concrete houses for sale and rental to Chinese traders.\nBy the 1920s, Phnom Penh was known as the \"Pearl of Asia\", and over the next four decades, Phnom Penh continued to experience rapid growth with the building of railways to Sihanoukville and Pochentong International Airport (now Phnom Penh International Airport). Phnom Penh's infrastructure saw major modernisation under the rule of Sihanouk.During the Vietnam War, Cambodia was used as a base by the People's Army of Vietnam (PAVN) and the Viet Cong (VC) and thousands of refugees from across the country flooded the city to escape the fighting between their own government troops, the PAVN/VC, the South Vietnamese and its allies and the Khmer Rouge and the American air strikes. By 1975, the population was 2\u20133 million, the bulk of whom were refugees from the fighting. The Khmer Rouge cut off supplies to the city for more than a year before it fell on April 17, 1975. Reports from journalists stated that the Khmer Rouge shelling \"tortured the capital almost continuously,\" inflicting \"random death and mutilation\" on millions of trapped civilians. The Khmer Rouge forcibly evacuated the entire city after taking it, in what has been described as a death march: Fran\u00e7ois Ponchaud wrote that \"I shall never forget one cripple who had neither hands nor feet, writhing along the ground like a severed worm, or a weeping father carrying his ten-year old daughter wrapped in a sheet tied around his neck like a sling, or the man with his foot dangling at the end of a leg to which it was attached by nothing but skin\"; Jon Swain recalled that the Khmer Rouge were \"tipping out patients from the hospitals like garbage into the streets....In five years of war, this is the greatest caravan of human misery I have seen.\" All of its residents, including the wealthy and educated, were evacuated from the city and forced to do difficult labour on rural farms as \"new people\". Tuol Sleng High School was taken over by Pol Pot's forces and was turned into the S-21 prison camp, where people were detained and tortured. Pol Pot sought a return to an agrarian economy and therefore killed many people perceived as educated, \"lazy\" or political enemies. Many others starved to death as a result of failure of the agrarian society and the sale of Cambodia's rice to China in exchange for bullets and weaponry. The former high school is now the Tuol Sleng Genocide Museum, where Khmer Rouge torture devices and photos of their victims are displayed. Choeung Ek (The Killing Fields), 15 kilometers (9 mi) away, where the Khmer Rouge marched prisoners from Tuol Sleng to be murdered and buried in shallow pits, is also now a memorial to those who were killed by the regime.\nThe Khmer Rouge were driven out of Phnom Penh by the PAVN in 1979, and people began to return to the city. Vietnam is historically a state with which Cambodia has had many conflicts, therefore this liberation was and is viewed with mixed emotions by the Cambodians. A period of reconstruction began, spurred by the continuing stability of government, attracting new foreign investment and aid by countries including France, Australia, and Japan. Loans were made from the Asian Development Bank and the World Bank to reinstate a clean water supply, roads and other infrastructure. The 1998 Census put Phnom Penh's population at 862,000; and the 2008 census was 1.3 million.\n\n\n== Geography ==\nPhnom Penh is in the south-central region of Cambodia, and is fully surrounded by Kandal Province. The municipality is on the banks of the Tonl\u00e9 Sap, Mekong, and Bassac Rivers. These rivers provide freshwater and other natural resources to the city. Phnom Penh and the surrounding areas consist of a typical flood plain area for Cambodia. Although Phnom Penh is at 11.89 metres (39 ft) above the river, monsoon season flooding is a problem, and the river sometimes overflows its banks.\nThe city, at 11.55\u00b0N 104.91667\u00b0E\ufeff / 11.55; 104.91667 (11\u00b033' North, 104\u00b055' East), covers an area of 678.46 square kilometres (262 sq mi), with some 11,401 hectares (28,172 acres) in the municipality and 26,106 ha (64,509 acres) of roads. The agricultural land in the municipality amounts to 34.685 km2 (13 sq mi) with some 1.476 km2 (365 acres) under irrigation.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nPhnom Penh has a tropical wet and dry climate (K\u00f6ppen climate classification Aw). The climate is hot year-round with only minor variations. Temperatures typically range from 22 to 35 \u00b0C (72 to 95 \u00b0F) and weather is subject to the tropical monsoons. The southwest monsoon blows inland bringing moisture-laden winds from the Gulf of Thailand and Indian Ocean from May to November. The northeast monsoon ushers in the dry season, which lasts from December to April. The city experiences the heaviest precipitation from September to October with the driest period in January and February.\nThe city has two distinct seasons. The rainy season, which runs from May to November, sees high temperatures accompanied by high humidity. The dry season lasts from December to April; when overnight temperatures can drop to 22 \u00b0C (72 \u00b0F).\n\n\n== Administration ==\n\nPhnom Penh is a municipality of area 678.46 square kilometres (261.95 sq mi) with a government status equal to that of Cambodian provinces. The municipality is divided into 14 administrative divisions called khans (sections). The sections are subdivided into 105 sangkats (quarters), and further subdivided into 953 phums (villages).  All khans are under the governance of the Phnom Penh Municipality. Dangkao, Meanchey, Porsenchey, Sen Sok and Russei Keo are considered the outskirts of the city.\nThe municipality is governed by the governor who acts as the top executive of the city as well as overseeing the Municipal Military Police, Municipal Police, and Bureau of Urban Affairs. Below the governor is the first vice governor and five vice governors. The chief of cabinet, who holds the same status as the vice governors, heads the cabinet consisting of eight deputy chiefs of cabinet who in turn are in charge of the 27 administrative departments. Every khan (district) also has a chief.\n\n\n== Demographics ==\nAs of 2019, Phnom Penh had a population of 2,129,371 people, with a total population density of 3,136 inhabitants per square kilometre in a 679 square kilometres (262 sq mi) city area. The population growth rate of the city is 3.92%. The city area has grown fourfold since 1979, and the metro area will continue to expand in order to support the city's growing population and economy.\nPhnom Penh is mostly inhabited by Cambodians (or Khmers). They represent 90% of the population of the city. There are large minorities of Chinese, Vietnamese, and other small ethnic groups who are Thai, Budong, Mnong Preh, Kuy, Chong, and Chams. The state religion is Theravada Buddhism. More than 90% of the people in Phnom Penh are Buddhists. Chams have been practicing Islam for hundreds of years. Since 1993, there has also been an increase in the practice of Christianity which was practically wiped out after 1975 when the Khmer Rouge took over. The official language is Khmer, but English and French are widely used in the city.\nThe number of slum-inhabitants at the end of 2012 was 105,771, compared with 85,807 at the start of 2012.Note: As stated in the \"History\" paragraph (The 1998 Census put Phnom Penh's population at 862,000; and the 2008 census was 1.3 million.) the information collides with the information provided in the \"Historical population\" table. Needs editing.\n\n\n== Politics ==\n\n \nPhnom Penh is allocated 12 seats in the National Assembly, making it the largest constituency.\n\n\n=== Members of Parliament ===\n\n\n== Economy ==\n\nPhnom Penh is Cambodia's economic centre as it accounts for a large portion of the Cambodian economy. Double-digit economic growth rates in recent years have triggered an economic boom in Phnom Penh, with new hotels, restaurants, schools, bars, high rises and residential buildings springing up in the city.\nThe economy is based on commercial interests such as garments, trading, and small and medium enterprises. In the past few years the property business has been booming, with rapidly increasing real estate prices. Tourism is also a major contributor in the capital as more shopping and commercial centres open, making Phnom Penh one of the major tourist destinations in South East Asia along with Siem Reap and Sihanoukville. According to the World Travel and Tourism Council, tourism made up 19.2 percent (US$2,053 million) of Cambodia's GDP in 2009 and accounts for 13.7 percent of total employment. One of the most popular areas in Phnom Penh for tourists is Sisowath Quay, alongside the Tonle Sap River. Sisowath Quay is a five kilometre strip of road that includes restaurants, bars, and hotels.The US$2.6 billion new urban development, Camko City, is meant to bolster the city landscape. The Bureau of Urban Affairs of Pnochina Penh Municipality has plans to expand and construct new infrastructure to accommodate the growing population and economy. High rise buildings will be chinesely constructed at the entrance of the city and near the lakes and riverbanks. Furthermore, new roads, canals, and a railway system will be used to connect Camko City and Phnom Penh.\nOther projects include:\n\nGrand Phnom Penh International City (under construction)\nDe Castle Royal Condominium (Completed)\nGold Tower 42 (On hold 32 floors construction begins again in the mid of 2018)\nOCIC Tower (Completed)\nKokling super second floor house\nVattanac Capital Tower (completed)\nThe Bridge (Completed)\nThe Peak (under construction)\nWith booming economic growth seen since the 1990s, new shopping venues have opened: Sorya Center Point, Aeon Mall Phnom Penh, Aeon Mall Sen Sok City, Olympia Mall, and Parkson Mall (under construction). Many international brands have opened such as Mango, Salvatore Ferragamo, Hugo Boss, Padini Concept Store, Lily, Timberland, Jimmy Choo, CC Double O, MO, Brands Outlet, Nike, Converse, Pony, Armani Exchange, and Super Dry.\nThe tallest skyscraper in Phnom Penh is Vattanac Capital Tower at a height of 188 metres (617 ft), dominating Phnom Penh's skyline with its neighbour skyscraper Canadia Tower (OCIC Tower). The tower was completed in December 2014. Modern high rises have been constructed all around the city, not concentrated in any one particular area.\nThe Central Market Phsar Thmei is a tourist attraction. The four wings of the yellow colored market are teeming with numerous stalls selling gold and silver jewelry, antique coins, clothing, clocks, flowers, food, fabrics and shoes. Phsar Thmei is undergoing under a major renovation, along with the creation of newer stalls.\n\n\n== Education ==\n\n\n=== Universities and colleges ===\n\n\n=== Primary and secondary schools ===\n\n\n=== International schools ===\n\n\n=== Supplementary and extra schools ===\nThe Japanese Supplementary School of Phnom Penh , formerly known in English as the Phnom Penh Japanese School, is a part-time Japanese School, operated by the Japanese Association of Cambodia (JACAM;\u30ab\u30f3\u30dc\u30b8\u30a2\u65e5\u672c\u4eba\u4f1a Kambojia Nihonjin-kai). It is in Sangkat Toek Thla in Sen Sok. It was established in 2002. It had 60 students in June 2011.\n\n\n== Culture ==\nPhnom Penh also has its own dialect of Khmer. Speakers of the Phnom Penh dialect often elide syllables, which has earned it the reputation for being lazy speech. Phnom Penh is also known for its influence on New Khmer Architecture. Phnom Penh is notable for Ka tieu Phnom Penh, its variation on rice noodle soup, a dish available in sit-down cafes as well as street cafes.\nMusic and the arts are making a revival throughout Cambodia, especially in Phnom Penh. Phnom Penh currently hosts a number of music events throughout the city. 'Indie' bands (those without corporate sponsors) have grown in number due also in part to the emergence of private music schools such as SoundsKool Music (also operating in the city of Siem Reap), and Music Arts School (registered as an NGO).\nThe two most visited museums in the city are the National Museum, which is the country's leading historical and archaeological museum, and Tuol Sleng Genocide Museum, a former Khmer Rouge prison. The National Museum hosts celebrations of Cambodian dance and music, including a popular classic Apsara dance show of traditional folk dances as well as original creations.\nChaul Chnam Thmey April 13\u201315\n\nAt this time, Phnom Penh celebrates Cambodian New Year, an occasion increasingly popular with tourists. During this typically hottest part of the year, water gets thrown around adding to the party atmosphere along with dancing and music. The precise date changes year-by-year but this holiday lasts, at least, three days. This festival marks the turn of the year based on the ancient Khmer calendar and also marks the end of the prior year harvest.\nWater Festival November\n\nThe largest annual festival in Phnom Penh, this lively gathering celebrates the reversing of the flow of the Tonl\u00e9 Sap River. The holiday lasts three days as people flood into the city to enjoy the fireworks, boat races, live concerts, eating and partying. The boat racing dates back to ancient times marking the strengths of the Khmer marine forces during the Khmer Empire.\nOn 22 November 2010 at least 348 people were crushed to death in a bridge stampede at the festival.Pchum Ben October 11\u201315 (2012)\nPchum Ben is a very important aspect of Cambodian culture. It may be translated as \"gathering together\" to make offerings and is a time of reunion, commemoration, express love and appreciation for one's ancestors. By offering food and good karma to those possibly trapped in the spirit world, living relatives help assuage their misery and guide them back into the cycle of reincarnation.\nVisak Bochea May\n\nVes\u0101kha is an annual holiday observed traditionally by Buddhists in Cambodia. Sometimes informally called \"Buddha's Birthday\", it actually encompasses the birth, enlightenment (nirv\u0101\u1e47a), and passing away (Parinirv\u0101na) of Gautama Buddha.\n\n\n== Cityscape and architecture ==\n\nThe oldest structure is Wat Phnom from the founding days of the city, constructed in 1373. The main tourist attractions are the Royal Palace with the Silver Pagoda, and the National Museum, constructed during the French colonial era in the late-19th century in the classical Khmer style and hosting a vast collection of Khmer antiquities. The Independence Monument (Khmer: Vimean Akareach), although from the 1950s, is also constructed in the ancient Khmer style.\nThe French, who were the colonial masters from the 19th century to the 1940s, also left their mark, with various colonial villas, French churches, boulevards, and the Art Deco market Phsar Thom Thmei. A notable landmark of the colonial era is the Hotel Le Royal.\n\nStarting with independence from the French in the 1950s and lasting until the era of the Khmer Rouge in the 1970s, Phnom Penh underwent tremendous growth as the capital city of a newly independent country. King Sihanouk was eager to present a new style of architecture and thus invigorate the process of nation building. A new golden era of architecture took off, with various projects and young Khmer architects, often educated in France, given opportunities to design and construct. This new movement was called \"New Khmer Architecture\" and was often characterised by a fusion of Bauhaus, European post-modern architecture, and traditional elements from Angkor. The most prominent architect was Vann Molyvann, who was nominated chief national architect by the king himself in 1956. Molyvann created landmark buildings such as the Preah Suramarit National Theatre and the Council of Ministers building. Other architects helped construct the newly founded Royal Khmer University, the Institute of Foreign Languages, and the National Sports Centre. With the growth of the upper and entrepreneurial middle classes, new suburbs were built in the 1950s and 1960s. Although these buildings survived the Khmer Rouge era and the civil war, today they are under threat due to economic development and financial speculation. Villas and gardens from that era are being destroyed and redeveloped to make place for bigger structures. The landmark National Theatre by Molyvann was razed in 2008. A movement is rising in Cambodia to preserve this modernist heritage. Old villas are sometimes being converted into boutique hotels, such as the Knai Bang Chatt. \nMonuments and memorials to the genocide of the Khmer Rouge era in the 1970s are the Tuol Sleng Genocide Museum (a former high school used as a concentration camp) and, on the outskirts of the city, the Choeung Ek Genocide Center. The Cambodia-Vietnam Friendship Monument was commissioned by the Vietnamese communists as symbol of Khmer-Vietnamese friendship during the late-1970s following the liberation of Cambodia from the Khmer Rouge.\nThe population, foreign investment, and urban development in Phnom Penh grew dramatically during the 1990s and early-2000s. The rapid growth resulted in the city's infrastructure distinctly lacking (the drainage system is particularly notorious, and Phnom Penh frequently floods during the wet season), and a need for both residential and commercial spaces. The simultaneous demand for residential and commercial housing and the increase of international investment has led to the planning, if not construction, of several satellite cities. The largest of these cities are: Grand Phnom Penh International City, CamKo City, Diamond Island City, Boeung Kak Town, and Chruy Cangva City.\nOn the outskirts of the city, farmland has been developed into garment factories and housing for lower economic classes and those displaced by the new development in the city center.\n\n\n=== 2035 master plan ===\nOriginally intended to be completed by 2020, the 2035 master plan is a French-funded project for the development of Phnom Penh. Although the plan was approved by the Ministry of Land Management, Urban Planning and Construction in 2005, it has yet to be ratified by the Cabinet of Cambodia. The original plan details five edge-city projects connected to the historical city centre by waterways and tree-lined corridors.\n\n\n== Media ==\n\n\n=== Dailies ===\n\n\n==== Khmer ====\nSralagn' Khmer (Love Khmer)\nChakraval Daily (Universe)\nKampuchea Thmei Daily (New Cambodia)\nKampuchea Tgnai Nis (Cambodia Today)\nKanychok Sangkhum (Social Reflection)\nKoh Santepheap (Island of Peace)\nMoneaksekar Khmer (Khmer Conscience) \u2013 Published by the Sam Rainsy Party.\nRasmei Kampuchea (Light of Kampuchea) \u2013 Cambodia's largest daily, it circulates about 18,000 copies.\nSamleng Yuvachun (Voice of Khmer Youth)\nUdomkate Khmer (Khmer Ideal)\nWat Phnom Daily (Mount Temple)\n\n\n==== English ====\nPhnom Penh Post, a daily English-language newspaper published in Phnom Penh.\nThe Cambodia Daily, an English-language daily newspaper (closed in 2017).\nThe Khmer Times, an English-language daily newspaper.\n\n\n==== Chinese ====\n\u300a\u67ec\u83ef\u65e5\u5831\u300b(Jianhua Daily), a daily Chinese-language newspaper published in Phnom Penh.\n\u300a\u661f\u6d32\u65e5\u5831\u300b(Sin Chew Daily), a Chinese-language daily newspaper, the Cambodian edition of the Malaysian Chinese daily of the same name.\n\u300a\u83ef\u5546\u65e5\u5831\u300b(Huashang Daily), a Chinese-language daily newspaper.\n\u300a\u9ad8\u68c9\u65e5\u62a5\u300b(Khmer Daily), a Chinese-language daily newspaper.\n\u300a\u65b0\u67ec\u57d4\u5be8\u300b(New Cambodia), a Chinese-language daily newspaper.\n\n\n=== Magazines ===\nAsiaLIFE Guide Phnom Penh, a monthly English-language lifestyle magazine published in Phnom Penh.\nPocket Guide Cambodia publishes four separate guides aimed at English-speaking residents and visitors.\nF Magazine, the first fashion-forward magazine in Cambodia.

Cambodia has increasingly become involved in modern sports over the last 30 years. As with the rest of the country, football and the martial arts are particularly popular.  Ultimate fighting and freestyle boxing have also become more common in recent years.The most prominent sporting venue in the city is the Phnom Penh National Olympic Stadium with a capacity of 80,000\u2014although the country never hosted the Olympic Games due to disruption by the civil war and the Khmer Rouge in the 1970s. Built in 1964, it is home to the Cambodian national football team. On completion the stadium was one of the largest in Asia. Today it is the 6th largest stadium in Southeast Asia. Volleyball, basketball, and Tai-Kwon-Do games are often hosted at the stadium.  The stadium closed in 2000, but was redeveloped and reopened.\nThe National Sports Centre of Cambodia hosts swimming, boxing, and volleyball competitions. Noted local football clubs include Phnom Penh Empire, Khemara Keila FC and Military Police.\n\n\n== Transport ==\n\nPhnom Penh International Airport is the largest and busiest airport in Cambodia. It is seven kilometres west of central Phnom Penh. The airport is connected to the city center by taxi, train, and shuttle bus.\nCambodia's national flag carrier, Cambodia Angkor Air, launched in 2009, is headquartered in Phnom Penh and has its main hub there, with an additional hub at the Angkor International Airport.Air France used to serve Phnom Penh from Paris-Charles de Gaulle but this service has since stopped. Qatar Airways now flies to and from Phnom Penh, via Ho Chi Minh City.\nTaxis, pick-ups, and minibuses leave the city for destinations all over the country, but are fast losing ground to cheaper and more comfortable buses. Phnom Penh also has a rail service.\nThere are numerous bus companies, including Phnom Penh Public Transport and GST Express, running services to most provincial capitals, including Sihanoukville, Kampong Chhnang, Oudong and Tak\u00e9o. Phnom Penh Sorya Transport Co. offers bus service to several provincial destinations along the National Routes and to Ho Chi Minh City. Giant Ibis is another bus company based in Phnom Penh, which travels to Sihanoukville, Kampot, Siem Reap and Ho Chi Minh, and has free Wi-Fi, air conditioning and modest pricing.\nThe city is Cambodia's main freshwater port, a major port on the Mekong River. It is linked to the South China Sea, 290 kilometres distant, via a channel of the Mekong in Vietnam.\n\n\n=== Public transport ===\n\nPhnom Penh is served by three air conditioned bus lines. Initial attempts by the Japanese government to develop a Phnom Penh bus service began in 2001. An update of the JICA urban transport master plan for Phnom Penh was completed and implemented in 2014. The city is now served by three bus lines, operated by the Phnom Penh municipal government. Private transportation within the city include the cycle rickshaw, known in Khmer as \"cyclo\", the motorcycle taxi known in Khmer as \"moto\", the auto rickshaw known locally as \"tuk-tuk\", the trailer attached to a motorcycle taxi known in Khmer as \"remorque\", and the standard automobile taxicab known in Khmer as \"taxi\". Private forms of transportation used by locals include bicycles, motorbikes, and cars.\n\n\n=== Highways ===\n\nAs the capital of Cambodia, a number of national highways connect the city with various parts of the country:\n\n\n== Water supply ==\n\nWater supply in Phnom Penh has improved dramatically in terms of access, service quality, efficiency, cost recovery and governance between 1993 and 2006. The number of customers has increased ninefold, service quality has improved from intermittent to continuous supply, water losses have been cut dramatically and the city's water utility went from being bankrupt to making a modest profit. These achievements were recognized through international awards such as the 2006 Ramon Magsaysay Award and the 2010 Stockholm Industry Water Award. The city's water utility is the Phnom Penh Water Supply Authority (PPWSA). Its main water sources are the Mekong River, the Tonle Sap river and the Tonle Bassac river.\n\n\n== International relations ==\n\n\n=== Twin towns and sister cities ===\nPhnom Penh is twinned with:\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of markets in Phnom Penh\nSpecial Economic Zones of Cambodia\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\nGroslier, B.P.

          "We went to this mall just to check it out but it turned out to be a cool, quiet haven from the streets of Phnom Penh. The prices in most of the stores were reasonable and they had some nice places to eat. Glad we went.",

          "Aeon Mall is the latest in PP. To me, it shows the development of PP. You can find almost anything here but at a higher price. Personally feel that it's not so much about the shopping but a place I can just walk around and a place for a meal and coffee. Not bad!",

          "The Aeon mall is a mind blowing experience if you consider what most other markets in Cambodia look like.Yes it is sterile glitzy 4 D cinema. But sometimes you need a little of that. They have a great food court and the food is really not badly priced considering it is a mall.",

          "Visited Aeon Mall as were just Inquisitive as to what it was like. We were not disappointed it's just another air con mall with all yhe usual global brands which suck the money from developing countries. If you want to shop in an A/C mall visit Sorya Mall just one block south",
          "This mall brags of a 4D theater and it made the visit worthwhile. The mall has an abundance of dining establishments but clothing stores were merely adequate. Missing from the mall is any good computer retailer.",

          "Unless you need groceries, I am not sure why a tourist would come here. No luxury shops and I think there is 1 shop selling souvenirs. Some fast food restaurants and coffee shops. The only shop you might recognize from home is Mango.",

          "With the exception of the Aeon store itself the rest if the mall is largely filled with stores that are western and expensive. Seems the rush of opening has given way to the reality that only the super rich in Cambodia can really shop here Does have cinema and arcade games for",

          "Aeon Mall is nice, modern shopping mall. Some brand's of clothing and bags. But I ask myself who shopped here. One for example Arrow's shirt cost as average month's wage. Tourists have similar malls in their country, and better. In my opinion better choice for tourist is Central",
          "been going back and forth to PP countless times for the past 10 years and was glad to finally see a proper shopping centre with good choices, fantastic restaurants, and a host of other distractions. Traffic leading to the place though is terrible but hope it will improve soon.",
          "It was nice to get out of the heat for a while, it has quite a few shops, a food court, an arcade, cinema and bowling alley. After frequenting shopping centres for a break from the heat throughout our trip around Asia, this one was very average. Not bad, just average.",
          "An incongruous Western-style Japanese owned shopping mall south of the main city centre, with Western-style prices and plenty of Japanese and International brands on display. A visit here is quite a surreal experience, in a country where the average annual income is little more",

          "There are plenty of stores and international restaurants. We don't really shop here since you can buy similar items in Bkk or Sg with cheaper price. We stocked ourselves well for our snacks n drinks for our hotel minibar from Aeon Mall. Wines n alcohols are pretty cheap.",

          "I think for Cambodian standards its a very very nice mall. There is a huge variety of Japanese store's and also restaurants. If you are in Phnom Penh this mall should be on your bucket list. I have been to Emirates mall which you obviously cannot compare the 2 but its worth",

It is located in the Pou Senchey District, 10 kilometres (5.4 NM) west of Phnom Penh, the nation's capital.\n\n\n== History ==\nPhnom Penh airport's former name was Pochentong International Airport (Khmer: \u17a2\u17b6\u1780\u17b6\u179f\u1799\u17b6\u1793\u178a\u17d2\u178b\u17b6\u1793\u17a2\u1793\u17d2\u178f\u179a\u1787\u17b6\u178f\u17b7\u1796\u17c4\u1792\u17b7\u17cd\u1785\u17b7\u1793\u178f\u17bb\u1784). On 6 July 1995, the Royal Government of Cambodia (RGC) signed a concession agreement with the French\u2013Malaysian joint venture company Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Concessionaire d'A\u00e9roport (SCA), to operate Phnom Penh (PNH) \u2013 Pochentong International Airport. In return for a 20-year concession, SCA\u201470 per cent owned by Groupe GTM and 30 per cent by Muhibbah Masterron of Malaysia\u2014committed to a $100 million improvement program that includes the construction of a new runway, terminal and cargo buildings, hangars, installation of a Cat III level Instrument Landing System (ILS) and associated approach lighting. The Berger Group was selected by the RGC to provide independent engineering services during the concession, to audit the design and to advise on the practicality and cost of the concession's proposed improvements. The Berger team also supervised the initial works to accommodate widebody aircraft such as 747s, including asphalt concrete runway overlays; installation of new ILS, metrological equipment, runway lighting and generator and power systems; and construction of a new fire station, taxiway and turn-pad extensions. Following the successful completion of the initial works, the Berger team provided design review and independent engineering services for the construction of a new 20,000-square-metre (220,000 sq ft) terminal building to accommodate growing tourist traffic. The $20 million terminal building includes four mobile aerobridges, over 1000 auto parking spaces and VIP and CIP facilities.\n\n\n== Facilities ==\n\n\n=== Overview ===\nThe airport is at an elevation of 40 feet (12 m) above mean sea level. It has one runway designated 05/23 with an asphalt surface measuring 3,000 by 50 metres (9,840 ft \u00d7 160 ft). The airport has two terminal buildings \u2013 one for international and one for domestic operations. Recently, it added a new facility for VIP service. The international terminal has four aerobridges built in 2003. Three more aerobridges were added during the passenger terminal expansion in 2016\u20132017. The airport's design capacity is 5 million people per year.\n\n\n=== Expansion ===\nIn 2014, Cambodia Airports announced a $100 million project to expand the passenger terminals at Phnom Penh and Siem Reap international airports to accommodate continued strong passenger growth. The project saw the extension of the parking lots and terminals, more check-in and immigration counters, and new baggage handling systems. Additionally, the commercial areas were enlarged to allow for more retail shops, new restaurants and food and beverage outlets, and mezzanine lounges to cater to first class and business travellers. The expansions will allow the airport to double its capacity to handle 5 million passengers a year from 2.5 million passengers.\n\n\n== Airlines and destinations ==\n\n\n=== Passenger ===\nDue to  the COVID-19 pandemic, most flights will only resume operations on 1 July 2020\n\n\n=== Cargo ===\n\n\n== Statistics ==\n\n\n== Ground transportation ==\n\nThere are a few options to transfer to or from Phnom Penh International Airport and the city. Outside the arrival hall, passengers can take a taxi provided by the Airport Taxi Association or book a ride from Grab, a ride-hailing app. In April 2018, trains operated by Royal Railway Cambodia began running express from Phnom Penh International Airport (parking area) to Phnom Penh Railway Station (City Center). Trains run every 30 minutes and the journey takes roughly 30 minutes. A one-way trip costs USD$2.50. There is also the city bus and an airport express bus.\n\n\n== Accidents and incidents ==\nOn 3 December 1973, Douglas DC-3 XW-PHV of Air Union was reported to have crashed shortly after take-off.\nOn 19 January 1975, Douglas C-47A XU-HAK, Douglas DC-3 XU-KAL of Khmer Hansa and Douglas C-47A N86AC of South East Asia Air Transport were all destroyed in a rocket attack on the airport.\nOn 22 February 1975, Douglas C-47A XU-GAJ of Khmer Hansa was damaged beyond economic repair in a rocket attack.\nOn 10 March 1975, a Douglas DC-3 of Samaki Airlines was damaged beyond economic repair in a rocket attack.\nOn 11 March 1975, a Douglas DC-3 of Khmer Hansa was damaged beyond economic repair in a rocket attack.\nIn March 1975, Vickers Viscount XW-TDN of Royal Air Lao crashed at Phnom Penh International Airport. The pilot was not qualified to fly the aircraft. All four people on board were killed. Accident aircraft also reported as XW-TFK with a date of 15 March.\nOn 11 April 1975, a Douglas DC-3 (possibly XW-PKT) of Sorya Airlines was hit by shrapnel shortly after take-off. The aircraft was destroyed by fire and two of the three occupants were killed. The same day, Douglas C-47B XW-TFB of Air Cambodge was damaged beyond economic repair in a rocket attack.\n3 September 1997: Vietnam Airlines Flight 815, operated by a Tupolev Tu-134 crashed on approach to Pochentong Airport, killing 65 of the 66 passengers on board. The aircraft was entirely destroyed. The aircraft was flying from Ho Chi Minh City to Phnom Penh. The Tupolev was approaching the Phnom Penh airport runway in heavy rain from 2,000 meters; at this point the control tower ordered the pilot to attempt an approach from the west due to a wind pick-up. The crew then lost communication with the tower, and three minutes later the aircraft collided at low level with trees, damaging the left wing. The aircraft then slid 200 yards into a dry rice paddy before exploding. Pilot error was later identified as the cause of the crash; the pilot continued his landing descent from an altitude of 2,000 meters to 30 meters even though the runway was not in sight, and ignored pleas from his first officer and flight engineer to turn back. When the aircraft hit the trees, the pilot finally realized the runway was not in sight and tried to abort the approach; the flight engineer pushed for full power, but the aircraft lost control and veered left; the right engine then stalled, making it impossible to gain lift.\n\n\n== Future ==\nIn January 2018, the Cambodian government approved a proposal to build a new airport to serve Phnom Penh that will cost an estimated US$1.5 billion. The new international airport will replace the existing Phnom Penh International Airport, with initial plans having the facilities being constructed on partially reclaimed land adjacent to Boueng Cheung Loung, a large lake in Kandal province about 30 kilometres south of Phnom Penh.\nCambodia Airport Investment, a joint venture 90 percent owned by Overseas Cambodia Investment Corporation (OCIC), one of the country\u2019s largest real estate developers, and 10 percent by the government\u2019s State Secretariat of Civil Aviation, plans to invest the $1.5 billion to construct the new airport. The OCIC will invest US$280 million, while unspecified \"foreign banks\" will provide US$1.1 billion in funding. The OCIC will own 90 per cent of the shares in the completed airport, with the rest going to the SSCA While the construction plans are still in the early stages of development, the 4F class airport will be capable of handling large long-haul aircraft and will reportedly cover an area of around 2,600 hectares, which would make it one of the largest airports in the world.\n\n\n== See also ==\nSiem Reap International Airport\nSihanouk International Airport\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n=== Bibliography ===\nDe Launey, Guy (6 February 2006). \"Budget flights arrive in Southeast Asia\", BBC.\n\n\n== External links ==\n Media related to Phnom Penh International Airport at Wikimedia Commons\n\nPhnom Penh International Airport at Cambodia International Airports website\nCurrent weather for VDPP at NOAA/NWS\nAccident history for PNH at Aviation Safety Network",

      "text": {
        "wiki": "The Bophana Center is an audiovisual center located in Phnom Penh, Cambodia. The center is dedicated to restoring, protecting and enhancing the Cambodian audiovisual heritage.\nThe Bophana Center was co-founded in late 2006 by leu Pannakar and Cambodian-French filmmaker Rithy Panh. Rithy Panh has been critically acclaimed for his work. Most recently, he received the top prize of the \"Un certain regard\" competition at the 2013 Cannes Film Festival for his documentary The Missing Picture.The Bophana Center is an official member of the International Federation of Television Archives (FIAT) and the International Federation of Film Archives (FIAF).\n\n\n== The origins of the Bophana Center ==\nAs a survivor of the Khmer Rouge genocide, Rithy Panh moved to France in 1980. After rejecting the memory of his early years in Cambodia and then in the refugee camps in Thailand, he abandoned his carpentry studies to devote himself to cinema. He graduated from IDHEC in 1988.\nBetween 1975 and 1979, the Khmer Rouge destroyed the major part of Cambodian cultural productions. During the 1990s, Rithy Panh and Pannakar Leu, former director of the Cambodian Centre cinema envisioned the creation of a center dedicated to the restoration of the Cambodian audiovisual heritage.\nThe Bophana Center took shape during the early 2000s with the support of the National Audiovisual Institute (INA). It was inaugurated in Phnom Penh on December 4th, 2006.\nSince its launch, the Bophana Center has been fulfilling three goals: archiving, creation and training. It aims to contribute to the duty of remembrance associated with the Khmer Rouge dictatorship by collecting archives (audiovisual and written), organizing cultural events (screenings, exhibitions and conferences) and training Cambodian young people in cinematography.\n\"[The] role [of Bophana Center] is to give back remembrance to Cambodians. Forgetting is an affront to history and contributes to a deficit of democracy.\"\nThe Bophana Center is named after a young Cambodian woman incarcerated in the S21 detention camp. During the dictatorship, Bophana would write secret love letters to her husband. That act of resistance resulted in her being tortured for several months. She was executed in 1977 when she was only 25. The movie Bophana: A Cambodian Tragedy, directed by Rithy Panh in 1996, tells her story.\n\n\n== Architecture ==\nThe Bophana Center is located in the \"White House\", a building from the 1960s, whose style recalls Le Corbusier and Vann Mo-Lyvann. Surviving the Khmer regime and the successive phases of urbanization of the city, it was restored in 2006 to its original architecture with the help of Ministry of Culture and Fine Arts of Cambodia.\n\n\n== The center's activities ==\n\n\n=== Archives ===\nThe Bophana Center collects all types of archives from recent works of Cambodian filmmakers, through early films by the Lumi\u00e8re Brothers, to King Norodom Sihanouk's movies. The archives come from Cambodia, France and the United States. Over 2,000 titles, 700 hours of video archives, 210 hours of audio records and 10,000 images are listed in Khmer, French and English and available to the public for free on the \"Hanuman Database\" digital platform. To date, more than 240,000 people have visited the archives of the Bophana Center.\n\n\n=== Screenings ===\nEach week the Bophana Centre organizes free screenings of classic, Cambodian and foreign independent films.  The Bophana Center has also set up a free Movie Club open to Cambodians and aimed at young audiences.\n\n\n=== Exhibitions ===\nThe Bophana Center regularly exhibits Cambodian and foreign artists whose work aims to represent the various facets of Cambodia.\n\n\n=== Conferences ===\nThe Bophana Centre organizes conferences about Cambodia's history, architecture and traditions.\n\n\n=== Film school ===\nThe Bophana Center has a film production that trains young Cambodians. They are supervised by Rithy Panh as well as movie professionals.\n\n\n== The projects of the Bophana Center ==\n\n\n=== One dollar project ===\nSince 2014, One Dollar Project collects short films made by filmmakers from emerging countries in order to film the daily life of people living in poverty.\n\n\n=== Mobile screenings ===\nSince 2008, the Bophana Centre organizes traveling projections in the Cambodian province. Over 23 000 people attended in 2013.\n\n\n=== CIFF ===\nSince 2010, the Bophana Center and the Film Commission have been hosting the CIFF (Cambodia International Film Festival). The CIFF is free and funds films produced in Cambodia.\n\n\n== Services ==\nThe Bophana Center also has:\n\na production and video editing department,\na library, and\na coffee shop.\n\n\n== References ==",

'City of the Brahma's Faces') or shortly known as Krong Chaktomuk (Khmer: \u1780\u17d2\u179a\u17bb\u1784\u1785\u178f\u17bb\u1798\u17bb\u1781), is the capital and most populous city in Cambodia. Phnom Penh has been the national capital since French colonization of Cambodia, and has grown to become the nation's economic, industrial, and cultural center.\nOnce known as the \"Pearl of Asia,\" it was considered one of the loveliest French-built cities in Indochina in the 1920s. Phnom Penh, along with Siem Reap and Sihanoukville, are significant global and domestic tourist destinations for Cambodia. Founded in 1372, the city is noted for its historical architecture and attractions. It became the national capital in 1434 following the fall of Angkor, and remained so until 1497. It regained its capital status during the French colonial era in 1865. There are a number of surviving French colonial buildings scattered along the grand boulevards.\nOn the banks of the Tonl\u00e9 Sap, Mekong, and Bassac Rivers, Phnom Penh is home to more than 2 million people, approximately 14% of the Cambodian population.\n\n\n== Etymology ==\nPhnom Penh (literally, 'Penh's Hill') takes its name from the present Wat Phnom ('Hill Temple'). Legend has it that in 1372, a wealthy widow named Lady Penh found a Koki tree floating down the Tonle Sap river after a storm. Inside the tree were four bronze Buddha statues and a stone statue of Vishnu. Daun Penh ordered villagers to raise the height of the hill northeast of her house and used the Koki wood to build a temple on the hill to house the four Buddha statues, and a shrine for the Vishnu image slightly lower down. The temple became known as Wat Phnom Daun Penh, which is now known as Wat Phnom, a small hill 27 metres (89 ft) in height.\nPhnom Penh's official name, in its short form, is Krong Chaktomok (Khmer: \u1780\u17d2\u179a\u17bb\u1784\u1785\u178f\u17bb\u1798\u17bb\u1781) meaning \"City of Four Faces\".

This loosely translates as \"The place of four rivers that gives the happiness and success of Khmer Kingdom, the highest leader as well as impregnable city of the God Indra of the great kingdom\".\n\n\n== History ==\nFirst recorded a century after it is said to have taken place, the legend of the founding of Phnom Penh tells of a local woman, Penh (commonly referred to as Daun Penh (\"Grandmother Penh\" or \"Old Lady Penh\") in Khmer), living at Chaktomuk, the future Phnom Penh. It was the late 14th century, and the Khmer capital was still at Angkor near Siem Reap 350 km (217 mi) to the north. Gathering firewood along the banks of the river, Lady Penh spied a floating koki tree in the river and fished it from the water. Inside the tree she found four Buddha statues and one of Vishnu.\nThe discovery was taken as a divine blessing, and to some a sign that the Khmer capital was to be brought to Phnom Penh from Angkor. To house the new-found sacred objects, Penh raised a small hill on the west bank of the Tonle Sap River and crowned it with a shrine, now known as Wat Phnom at the north end of central Phnom Penh. \"Phnom\" is Khmer for \"hill\" and Penh's hill took on the name of the founder, and the area around it became known after the hill.\nPhnom Penh first became the capital of Cambodia after Ponhea Yat, king of the Khmer Empire, moved the capital from Angkor Thom after it was captured and destroyed by Siam a few years earlier. There is a stupa behind Wat Phnom that houses the remains of Ponhea Yat and the royal family as well as the remaining Buddhist statues from the Angkorean era. In the 17th century, Japanese immigrants also settled on the outskirts of present-day Phnom Penh. A small Portuguese community survived in Phnom Penh until the 17th century, undertaking commercial and religious activity in the country.\nPhnom Penh remained the royal capital for 73 years, from 1432 to 1505. It was abandoned for 360 years (from 1505 to 1865) by subsequent kings due to internal fighting between the royal pretenders. Later kings moved the capital several times and established their royal capitals at various locations in Tuol Basan (Srey Santhor), Pursat, Longvek, Lavear Em and Oudong.\nIt was not until 1866, under the reign of King Norodom I (1860\u20131904), the eldest son of King Ang Duong, who ruled on behalf of Siam, that Phnom Penh became the permanent seat of government and capital of Cambodia, and also where the current Royal Palace was built. Beginning in 1870, the French colonial authorities turned a riverside village into a city where they built hotels, schools, prisons, barracks, banks, public works offices, telegraph offices, law courts, and health services buildings. In 1872, the first glimpse of a modern city took shape when the colonial administration employed the services of French contractor Le Faucheur to construct the first 300 concrete houses for sale and rental to Chinese traders.\nBy the 1920s, Phnom Penh was known as the \"Pearl of Asia\", and over the next four decades, Phnom Penh continued to experience rapid growth with the building of railways to Sihanoukville and Pochentong International Airport (now Phnom Penh International Airport). Phnom Penh's infrastructure saw major modernisation under the rule of Sihanouk.During the Vietnam War, Cambodia was used as a base by the People's Army of Vietnam (PAVN) and the Viet Cong (VC) and thousands of refugees from across the country flooded the city to escape the fighting between their own government troops, the PAVN/VC, the South Vietnamese and its allies and the Khmer Rouge and the American air strikes. By 1975, the population was 2\u20133 million, the bulk of whom were refugees from the fighting. The Khmer Rouge cut off supplies to the city for more than a year before it fell on April 17, 1975. Reports from journalists stated that the Khmer Rouge shelling \"tortured the capital almost continuously,\" inflicting \"random death and mutilation\" on millions of trapped civilians. The Khmer Rouge forcibly evacuated the entire city after taking it, in what has been described as a death march: Fran\u00e7ois Ponchaud wrote that \"I shall never forget one cripple who had neither hands nor feet, writhing along the ground like a severed worm, or a weeping father carrying his ten-year old daughter wrapped in a sheet tied around his neck like a sling, or the man with his foot dangling at the end of a leg to which it was attached by nothing but skin\"; Jon Swain recalled that the Khmer Rouge were \"tipping out patients from the hospitals like garbage into the streets....In five years of war, this is the greatest caravan of human misery I have seen.\" All of its residents, including the wealthy and educated, were evacuated from the city and forced to do difficult labour on rural farms as \"new people\". Tuol Sleng High School was taken over by Pol Pot's forces and was turned into the S-21 prison camp, where people were detained and tortured. Pol Pot sought a return to an agrarian economy and therefore killed many people perceived as educated, \"lazy\" or political enemies. Many others starved to death as a result of failure of the agrarian society and the sale of Cambodia's rice to China in exchange for bullets and weaponry. The former high school is now the Tuol Sleng Genocide Museum, where Khmer Rouge torture devices and photos of their victims are displayed. Choeung Ek (The Killing Fields), 15 kilometers (9 mi) away, where the Khmer Rouge marched prisoners from Tuol Sleng to be murdered and buried in shallow pits, is also now a memorial to those who were killed by the regime.\nThe Khmer Rouge were driven out of Phnom Penh by the PAVN in 1979, and people began to return to the city. Vietnam is historically a state with which Cambodia has had many conflicts, therefore this liberation was and is viewed with mixed emotions by the Cambodians. A period of reconstruction began, spurred by the continuing stability of government, attracting new foreign investment and aid by countries including France, Australia, and Japan. Loans were made from the Asian Development Bank and the World Bank to reinstate a clean water supply, roads and other infrastructure. The 1998 Census put Phnom Penh's population at 862,000; and the 2008 census was 1.3 million.\n\n\n== Geography ==\nPhnom Penh is in the south-central region of Cambodia, and is fully surrounded by Kandal Province. The municipality is on the banks of the Tonl\u00e9 Sap, Mekong, and Bassac Rivers. These rivers provide freshwater and other natural resources to the city. Phnom Penh and the surrounding areas consist of a typical flood plain area for Cambodia. Although Phnom Penh is at 11.89 metres (39 ft) above the river, monsoon season flooding is a problem, and the river sometimes overflows its banks.\nThe city, at 11.55\u00b0N 104.91667\u00b0E\ufeff / 11.55; 104.91667 (11\u00b033' North, 104\u00b055' East), covers an area of 678.46 square kilometres (262 sq mi), with some 11,401 hectares (28,172 acres) in the municipality and 26,106 ha (64,509 acres) of roads. The agricultural land in the municipality amounts to 34.685 km2 (13 sq mi) with some 1.476 km2 (365 acres) under irrigation.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nPhnom Penh has a tropical wet and dry climate (K\u00f6ppen climate classification Aw). The climate is hot year-round with only minor variations. Temperatures typically range from 22 to 35 \u00b0C (72 to 95 \u00b0F) and weather is subject to the tropical monsoons. The southwest monsoon blows inland bringing moisture-laden winds from the Gulf of Thailand and Indian Ocean from May to November. The northeast monsoon ushers in the dry season, which lasts from December to April. The city experiences the heaviest precipitation from September to October with the driest period in January and February.\nThe city has two distinct seasons. The rainy season, which runs from May to November, sees high temperatures accompanied by high humidity. The dry season lasts from December to April; when overnight temperatures can drop to 22 \u00b0C (72 \u00b0F).\n\n\n== Administration ==\n\nPhnom Penh is a municipality of area 678.46 square kilometres (261.95 sq mi) with a government status equal to that of Cambodian provinces. The municipality is divided into 14 administrative divisions called khans (sections). The sections are subdivided into 105 sangkats (quarters), and further subdivided into 953 phums (villages).  All khans are under the governance of the Phnom Penh Municipality. Dangkao, Meanchey, Porsenchey, Sen Sok and Russei Keo are considered the outskirts of the city.\nThe municipality is governed by the governor who acts as the top executive of the city as well as overseeing the Municipal Military Police, Municipal Police, and Bureau of Urban Affairs. Below the governor is the first vice governor and five vice governors. The chief of cabinet, who holds the same status as the vice governors, heads the cabinet consisting of eight deputy chiefs of cabinet who in turn are in charge of the 27 administrative departments. Every khan (district) also has a chief.\n\n\n== Demographics ==\nAs of 2019, Phnom Penh had a population of 2,129,371 people, with a total population density of 3,136 inhabitants per square kilometre in a 679 square kilometres (262 sq mi) city area. The population growth rate of the city is 3.92%. The city area has grown fourfold since 1979, and the metro area will continue to expand in order to support the city's growing population and economy.\nPhnom Penh is mostly inhabited by Cambodians (or Khmers). They represent 90% of the population of the city. There are large minorities of Chinese, Vietnamese, and other small ethnic groups who are Thai, Budong, Mnong Preh, Kuy, Chong, and Chams. The state religion is Theravada Buddhism. More than 90% of the people in Phnom Penh are Buddhists. Chams have been practicing Islam for hundreds of years. Since 1993, there has also been an increase in the practice of Christianity which was practically wiped out after 1975 when the Khmer Rouge took over. The official language is Khmer, but English and French are widely used in the city.\nThe number of slum-inhabitants at the end of 2012 was 105,771, compared with 85,807 at the start of 2012.Note: As stated in the \"History\" paragraph (The 1998 Census put Phnom Penh's population at 862,000; and the 2008 census was 1.3 million.) the information collides with the information provided in the \"Historical population\" table. Needs editing.\n\n\n== Politics ==\n\n \nPhnom Penh is allocated 12 seats in the National Assembly, making it the largest constituency.\n\n\n=== Members of Parliament ===\n\n\n== Economy ==\n\nPhnom Penh is Cambodia's economic centre as it accounts for a large portion of the Cambodian economy. Double-digit economic growth rates in recent years have triggered an economic boom in Phnom Penh, with new hotels, restaurants, schools, bars, high rises and residential buildings springing up in the city.\nThe economy is based on commercial interests such as garments, trading, and small and medium enterprises. In the past few years the property business has been booming, with rapidly increasing real estate prices. Tourism is also a major contributor in the capital as more shopping and commercial centres open, making Phnom Penh one of the major tourist destinations in South East Asia along with Siem Reap and Sihanoukville. According to the World Travel and Tourism Council, tourism made up 19.2 percent (US$2,053 million) of Cambodia's GDP in 2009 and accounts for 13.7 percent of total employment. One of the most popular areas in Phnom Penh for tourists is Sisowath Quay, alongside the Tonle Sap River. Sisowath Quay is a five kilometre strip of road that includes restaurants, bars, and hotels.The US$2.6 billion new urban development, Camko City, is meant to bolster the city landscape. The Bureau of Urban Affairs of Pnochina Penh Municipality has plans to expand and construct new infrastructure to accommodate the growing population and economy. High rise buildings will be chinesely constructed at the entrance of the city and near the lakes and riverbanks. Furthermore, new roads, canals, and a railway system will be used to connect Camko City and Phnom Penh.\nOther projects include:\n\nGrand Phnom Penh International City (under construction)\nDe Castle Royal Condominium (Completed)\nGold Tower 42 (On hold 32 floors construction begins again in the mid of 2018)\nOCIC Tower (Completed)\nKokling super second floor house\nVattanac Capital Tower (completed)\nThe Bridge (Completed)\nThe Peak (under construction)\nWith booming economic growth seen since the 1990s, new shopping venues have opened: Sorya Center Point, Aeon Mall Phnom Penh, Aeon Mall Sen Sok City, Olympia Mall, and Parkson Mall (under construction). Many international brands have opened such as Mango, Salvatore Ferragamo, Hugo Boss, Padini Concept Store, Lily, Timberland, Jimmy Choo, CC Double O, MO, Brands Outlet, Nike, Converse, Pony, Armani Exchange, and Super Dry.\nThe tallest skyscraper in Phnom Penh is Vattanac Capital Tower at a height of 188 metres (617 ft), dominating Phnom Penh's skyline with its neighbour skyscraper Canadia Tower (OCIC Tower). The tower was completed in December 2014. Modern high rises have been constructed all around the city, not concentrated in any one particular area.\nThe Central Market Phsar Thmei is a tourist attraction. The four wings of the yellow colored market are teeming with numerous stalls selling gold and silver jewelry, antique coins, clothing, clocks, flowers, food, fabrics and shoes. Phsar Thmei is undergoing under a major renovation, along with the creation of newer stalls.\n\n\n== Education ==\n\n\n=== Universities and colleges ===\n\n\n=== Primary and secondary schools ===\n\n\n=== International schools ===\n\n\n=== Supplementary and extra schools ===\nThe Japanese Supplementary School of Phnom Penh , formerly known in English as the Phnom Penh Japanese School, is a part-time Japanese School, operated by the Japanese Association of Cambodia (JACAM;\u30ab\u30f3\u30dc\u30b8\u30a2\u65e5\u672c\u4eba\u4f1a Kambojia Nihonjin-kai). It is in Sangkat Toek Thla in Sen Sok. It was established in 2002. It had 60 students in June 2011.\n\n\n== Culture ==\nPhnom Penh also has its own dialect of Khmer. Speakers of the Phnom Penh dialect often elide syllables, which has earned it the reputation for being lazy speech. Phnom Penh is also known for its influence on New Khmer Architecture. Phnom Penh is notable for Ka tieu Phnom Penh, its variation on rice noodle soup, a dish available in sit-down cafes as well as street cafes.\nMusic and the arts are making a revival throughout Cambodia, especially in Phnom Penh. Phnom Penh currently hosts a number of music events throughout the city. 'Indie' bands (those without corporate sponsors) have grown in number due also in part to the emergence of private music schools such as SoundsKool Music (also operating in the city of Siem Reap), and Music Arts School (registered as an NGO).\nThe two most visited museums in the city are the National Museum, which is the country's leading historical and archaeological museum, and Tuol Sleng Genocide Museum, a former Khmer Rouge prison. The National Museum hosts celebrations of Cambodian dance and music, including a popular classic Apsara dance show of traditional folk dances as well as original creations.\nChaul Chnam Thmey April 13\u201315\n\nAt this time, Phnom Penh celebrates Cambodian New Year, an occasion increasingly popular with tourists. During this typically hottest part of the year, water gets thrown around adding to the party atmosphere along with dancing and music. The precise date changes year-by-year but this holiday lasts, at least, three days. This festival marks the turn of the year based on the ancient Khmer calendar and also marks the end of the prior year harvest.\nWater Festival November\n\nThe largest annual festival in Phnom Penh, this lively gathering celebrates the reversing of the flow of the Tonl\u00e9 Sap River. The holiday lasts three days as people flood into the city to enjoy the fireworks, boat races, live concerts, eating and partying. The boat racing dates back to ancient times marking the strengths of the Khmer marine forces during the Khmer Empire.\nOn 22 November 2010 at least 348 people were crushed to death in a bridge stampede at the festival.Pchum Ben October 11\u201315 (2012)\nPchum Ben is a very important aspect of Cambodian culture. It may be translated as \"gathering together\" to make offerings and is a time of reunion, commemoration, express love and appreciation for one's ancestors. By offering food and good karma to those possibly trapped in the spirit world, living relatives help assuage their misery and guide them back into the cycle of reincarnation.\nVisak Bochea May\n\nVes\u0101kha is an annual holiday observed traditionally by Buddhists in Cambodia. Sometimes informally called \"Buddha's Birthday\", it actually encompasses the birth, enlightenment (nirv\u0101\u1e47a), and passing away (Parinirv\u0101na) of Gautama Buddha.\n\n\n== Cityscape and architecture ==\n\nThe oldest structure is Wat Phnom from the founding days of the city, constructed in 1373. The main tourist attractions are the Royal Palace with the Silver Pagoda, and the National Museum, constructed during the French colonial era in the late-19th century in the classical Khmer style and hosting a vast collection of Khmer antiquities. The Independence Monument (Khmer: Vimean Akareach), although from the 1950s, is also constructed in the ancient Khmer style.\nThe French, who were the colonial masters from the 19th century to the 1940s, also left their mark, with various colonial villas, French churches, boulevards, and the Art Deco market Phsar Thom Thmei. A notable landmark of the colonial era is the Hotel Le Royal.\n\nStarting with independence from the French in the 1950s and lasting until the era of the Khmer Rouge in the 1970s, Phnom Penh underwent tremendous growth as the capital city of a newly independent country. King Sihanouk was eager to present a new style of architecture and thus invigorate the process of nation building. A new golden era of architecture took off, with various projects and young Khmer architects, often educated in France, given opportunities to design and construct. This new movement was called \"New Khmer Architecture\" and was often characterised by a fusion of Bauhaus, European post-modern architecture, and traditional elements from Angkor. The most prominent architect was Vann Molyvann, who was nominated chief national architect by the king himself in 1956. Molyvann created landmark buildings such as the Preah Suramarit National Theatre and the Council of Ministers building. Other architects helped construct the newly founded Royal Khmer University, the Institute of Foreign Languages, and the National Sports Centre. With the growth of the upper and entrepreneurial middle classes, new suburbs were built in the 1950s and 1960s. Although these buildings survived the Khmer Rouge era and the civil war, today they are under threat due to economic development and financial speculation. Villas and gardens from that era are being destroyed and redeveloped to make place for bigger structures. The landmark National Theatre by Molyvann was razed in 2008. A movement is rising in Cambodia to preserve this modernist heritage. Old villas are sometimes being converted into boutique hotels, such as the Knai Bang Chatt. \nMonuments and memorials to the genocide of the Khmer Rouge era in the 1970s are the Tuol Sleng Genocide Museum (a former high school used as a concentration camp) and, on the outskirts of the city, the Choeung Ek Genocide Center. The Cambodia-Vietnam Friendship Monument was commissioned by the Vietnamese communists as symbol of Khmer-Vietnamese friendship during the late-1970s following the liberation of Cambodia from the Khmer Rouge.\nThe population, foreign investment, and urban development in Phnom Penh grew dramatically during the 1990s and early-2000s. The rapid growth resulted in the city's infrastructure distinctly lacking (the drainage system is particularly notorious, and Phnom Penh frequently floods during the wet season), and a need for both residential and commercial spaces. The simultaneous demand for residential and commercial housing and the increase of international investment has led to the planning, if not construction, of several satellite cities. The largest of these cities are: Grand Phnom Penh International City, CamKo City, Diamond Island City, Boeung Kak Town, and Chruy Cangva City.\nOn the outskirts of the city, farmland has been developed into garment factories and housing for lower economic classes and those displaced by the new development in the city center.\n\n\n=== 2035 master plan ===\nOriginally intended to be completed by 2020, the 2035 master plan is a French-funded project for the development of Phnom Penh. Although the plan was approved by the Ministry of Land Management, Urban Planning and Construction in 2005, it has yet to be ratified by the Cabinet of Cambodia. The original plan details five edge-city projects connected to the historical city centre by waterways and tree-lined corridors.\n\n\n== Media ==\n\n\n=== Dailies ===\n\n\n==== Khmer ====\nSralagn' Khmer (Love Khmer)\nChakraval Daily (Universe)\nKampuchea Thmei Daily (New Cambodia)\nKampuchea Tgnai Nis (Cambodia Today)\nKanychok Sangkhum (Social Reflection)\nKoh Santepheap (Island of Peace)\nMoneaksekar Khmer (Khmer Conscience) \u2013 Published by the Sam Rainsy Party.\nRasmei Kampuchea (Light of Kampuchea) \u2013 Cambodia's largest daily, it circulates about 18,000 copies.\nSamleng Yuvachun (Voice of Khmer Youth)\nUdomkate Khmer (Khmer Ideal)\nWat Phnom Daily (Mount Temple)\n\n\n==== English ====\nPhnom Penh Post, a daily English-language newspaper published in Phnom Penh.\nThe Cambodia Daily, an English-language daily newspaper (closed in 2017).\nThe Khmer Times, an English-language daily newspaper.\n\n\n==== Chinese ====\n\u300a\u67ec\u83ef\u65e5\u5831\u300b(Jianhua Daily), a daily Chinese-language newspaper published in Phnom Penh.\n\u300a\u661f\u6d32\u65e5\u5831\u300b(Sin Chew Daily), a Chinese-language daily newspaper, the Cambodian edition of the Malaysian Chinese daily of the same name.\n\u300a\u83ef\u5546\u65e5\u5831\u300b(Huashang Daily), a Chinese-language daily newspaper.\n\u300a\u9ad8\u68c9\u65e5\u62a5\u300b(Khmer Daily), a Chinese-language daily newspaper.\n\u300a\u65b0\u67ec\u57d4\u5be8\u300b(New Cambodia), a Chinese-language daily newspaper.\n\n\n=== Magazines ===\nAsiaLIFE Guide Phnom Penh, a monthly English-language lifestyle magazine published in Phnom Penh.\nPocket Guide Cambodia publishes four separate guides aimed at English-speaking residents and visitors.\nF Magazine, the first fashion-forward magazine in Cambodia.

Cambodia has increasingly become involved in modern sports over the last 30 years. As with the rest of the country, football and the martial arts are particularly popular.  Ultimate fighting and freestyle boxing have also become more common in recent years.The most prominent sporting venue in the city is the Phnom Penh National Olympic Stadium with a capacity of 80,000\u2014although the country never hosted the Olympic Games due to disruption by the civil war and the Khmer Rouge in the 1970s. Built in 1964, it is home to the Cambodian national football team. On completion the stadium was one of the largest in Asia. Today it is the 6th largest stadium in Southeast Asia. Volleyball, basketball, and Tai-Kwon-Do games are often hosted at the stadium.  The stadium closed in 2000, but was redeveloped and reopened.\nThe National Sports Centre of Cambodia hosts swimming, boxing, and volleyball competitions. Noted local football clubs include Phnom Penh Empire, Khemara Keila FC and Military Police.\n\n\n== Transport ==\n\nPhnom Penh International Airport is the largest and busiest airport in Cambodia. It is seven kilometres west of central Phnom Penh. The airport is connected to the city center by taxi, train, and shuttle bus.\nCambodia's national flag carrier, Cambodia Angkor Air, launched in 2009, is headquartered in Phnom Penh and has its main hub there, with an additional hub at the Angkor International Airport.Air France used to serve Phnom Penh from Paris-Charles de Gaulle but this service has since stopped. Qatar Airways now flies to and from Phnom Penh, via Ho Chi Minh City.\nTaxis, pick-ups, and minibuses leave the city for destinations all over the country, but are fast losing ground to cheaper and more comfortable buses. Phnom Penh also has a rail service.\nThere are numerous bus companies, including Phnom Penh Public Transport and GST Express, running services to most provincial capitals, including Sihanoukville, Kampong Chhnang, Oudong and Tak\u00e9o. Phnom Penh Sorya Transport Co. offers bus service to several provincial destinations along the National Routes and to Ho Chi Minh City. Giant Ibis is another bus company based in Phnom Penh, which travels to Sihanoukville, Kampot, Siem Reap and Ho Chi Minh, and has free Wi-Fi, air conditioning and modest pricing.\nThe city is Cambodia's main freshwater port, a major port on the Mekong River. It is linked to the South China Sea, 290 kilometres distant, via a channel of the Mekong in Vietnam.\n\n\n=== Public transport ===\n\nPhnom Penh is served by three air conditioned bus lines. Initial attempts by the Japanese government to develop a Phnom Penh bus service began in 2001. An update of the JICA urban transport master plan for Phnom Penh was completed and implemented in 2014. The city is now served by three bus lines, operated by the Phnom Penh municipal government. Private transportation within the city include the cycle rickshaw, known in Khmer as \"cyclo\", the motorcycle taxi known in Khmer as \"moto\", the auto rickshaw known locally as \"tuk-tuk\", the trailer attached to a motorcycle taxi known in Khmer as \"remorque\", and the standard automobile taxicab known in Khmer as \"taxi\". Private forms of transportation used by locals include bicycles, motorbikes, and cars.\n\n\n=== Highways ===\n\nAs the capital of Cambodia, a number of national highways connect the city with various parts of the country:\n\n\n== Water supply ==\n\nWater supply in Phnom Penh has improved dramatically in terms of access, service quality, efficiency, cost recovery and governance between 1993 and 2006. The number of customers has increased ninefold, service quality has improved from intermittent to continuous supply, water losses have been cut dramatically and the city's water utility went from being bankrupt to making a modest profit. These achievements were recognized through international awards such as the 2006 Ramon Magsaysay Award and the 2010 Stockholm Industry Water Award. The city's water utility is the Phnom Penh Water Supply Authority (PPWSA). Its main water sources are the Mekong River, the Tonle Sap river and the Tonle Bassac river.\n\n\n== International relations ==\n\n\n=== Twin towns and sister cities ===\nPhnom Penh is twinned with:\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of markets in Phnom Penh\nSpecial Economic Zones of Cambodia\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\nGroslier, B.P.

Mainly used for the purpose of conducting ceremonies for foreign governors, the hall is a designed concrete structure which radiates in a fan shape referencing a palm leaf. The design combines traditional building elements (Khmer architecture) with a modern structure. Most of the events that take place in the hall are performance art and meetings of high class like royalties and presidents. \n\n\n== History ==\nIn 1961, Chaktomuk Conference Hall was originally opened as La Salle de Conference Chaktomuk. Many important government meetings would, at a majority take place in this very hall for conference purposes. Later on, 1991 this hall designated for redevelopment as a restaurant. With a great view of the Tonle Sap river, the customers had a great review. After a harmful yet devastating fire took place at the hall, it partly destroyed the hall that ruined the structure.The Chaktomuk Conference Hall in Phnom Penh has undergone several changes and was completely remodeled in the year 2000 mainly to provide international standard facilities for conferences, seminars and lectures. But because of the flexible design, Chaktomuk Conference Hall, Phnom Penh is used as a theater hall only for special programs and concerts organized by Ministry of Culture and Fine Arts in Cambodia.\n\n\n== Design ==\n\n\n=== Idea ===\nThe hall combines traditional Khmer elements with modern structural design. The design behind this structure was created by Vann Molyvann, one of the major practitioners of New Khmer Architecture. \nTo bring out the culture he was raised in, the building was designed as a concrete structure radiating in a fan, made to represent a palm leaf. The location was also a set back to the hall with a 270-degree view that can see the full views of the 4 rivers cross together forming a tributary to the spectacular view. It also included novel bio-climate features.\n\n\n=== Concept ===\nThe hall was made to accommodate 850 people. It was designed to have an open-space area that functioned as a multi-purpose room. Ventilation in tropical buildings is one of the most important features, which is provided here from the ground floor flowing up toward the backstage to flow in both directions. \nThe seating areas were made from the ground floor from the back of the building flowing underneath of the stage, an unusual design that made one of Cambodia's major attractions. To avoid the heat that was transmitted from the sunlight in the hall, a double roof was installed. 4 main entry doors were planned, with exits on the sides of the room to make it easy for the audience to enter and leave without disturbing the performers. The building's peculiar fan-shape enables the audience to have the full view of the stage without the need for standing up.\n\n\n== Events ==\nChaktomuk Conference hall used to be a restaurant then theatre but this hall nowadays is mainly used for the conference, lectures and occasional performing art activities.\n\n\n=== 2009 ===\nKing Norodom Sihamoni congratulate disabled Chinese artists at Chaktomuk Conference Hall\n\n\n=== 2014 ===\nRoyal Palace Minister Kong Sam Ol announced an event about the Water Festival nightmare that happen in 2010 which killed 353 people on the bridge to Koh Pich island in the hall.\n\n\n== References ==",
